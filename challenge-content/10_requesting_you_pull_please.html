  <p>Submit a Pull Request to the original Patchwork repository.</p>

  <h2>Pull Requests</h2>
  <p>Often when you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked, you'll want to send those changes to the maintainer of the original and <strong>request</strong> that they <strong>pull</strong> those changes into the original so that everyone can benefit from the updates—that's a <strong>pull request</strong>.</p>

  <p>We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make a <strong>pull request</strong> to add your username file to the original: <a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork" target="_blank">github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

  <h3>Create a pull request</h3>
  <p>Visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case <a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork">http://github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

  <p>Often GitHub will detect if you've pushed a branch to a fork and display it at the top of the original's website. If you see that with your 'add-username' branch, you can click to create a Pull Request from there. If not:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Click the green 'New pull request' button.</li>
    <li>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit. It should be the one with 'add-yourusername'.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You'll now see a page with the details of the pull request you're in the process of submitting. This page shows the commits and changes, in the form of a diff, associated with your pull request as compared to the 'gh-pages' branch of the original.</p>

  <p>If the original repository has a <strong>contribution documentation</strong>, GitHub will link to it. This is documentation from repository owners on how to best make contributions to that project—very helpful to read if you'd like to see your changes adopted!</p>

  <p>If everything on the page looks good and as you expect it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Click 'Create pull request'</li>
    <li>Add a title and description to the changes you're suggesting the original author pull in.</li>
    <li>Click 'Send pull request'!</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Bingo! You submitted a pull request—take a few seconds to bask in the moment.</strong>

  <p>If all is well with your pull request, it will be merged within moments. If it's not merged automatically within a few minutes, you'll then likely have some comments from @reporobot on why it couldn't merge it. If this is the case, close your pull request on GitHub, make the necessary changes to your branch, push those changes back to your fork and reopen (this will poke @reporobot to look over it again) your pull request.</p>
