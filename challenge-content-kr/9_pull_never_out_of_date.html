  <h3>Pulling from a Remote</h3>
  <p>If you're working on something with someone else you need to stay up to date with the latest changes. So you'll want to <strong>pull</strong> in any changes that may have been pushed to the central GitHub repository.</p>

  <h3>What has Reporobot been up to?</h3>
  <p>See if Reporobot has made any changes to your branch by pulling in any changes from the remote named 'origin' on GitHub:</p>

  <p><code class="shell">git pull &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;</code></p>

  <p>If nothing's changed, it will tell you 'Already up-to-date'. If there are changes, Git will merge those changes into your local version.</p>

  <p>Did Reporobot make changes? Git tells you where changes were made. You can open that file and see Reporobot's updates. Surprise, Reporobot is an artist!</p>
