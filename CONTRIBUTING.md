# Contributing to Git-it (on Electron)

Thanks for helping out! Though I haven't had time to go into detail about it, I've got a rough idea of how 
this project will work. You may want to open an issue first to clarify what you'd like to do and what my rough
plan for that bit was. See the [readme](/readme.md) for background on the project. 

Here are general bits and bobs for working on this project:

**Issues**

- Screenshots or gifs so that what you're seeing can be seen :art:.
- Please include what operating system you're using if you've run into a problem.
- Specifying what version of Node and npm you have wouldn't hurt either :arrow_heading_up:. 

**Pull Requets**

:raised_hands: Lower the burden on maintainers = Easier, faster merges :sparkles:

- A meaningful title and description.
 - _This lowers the burden on the maintainer to read your code and infer your intent._
- Keep code in the style/syntax of the project and use [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard)
  - _This makes the whole of the project's code conistent and is easiest on me, the primary maintainer._
- Keep Pull Requests focused and open multiple if need be.
  - _This makes each pull request easier to review and accept (and, if need be, revert later on)._
- Use screenshots in PR when contributing visual changes. Use gifs too if you can (and if applicable)!
  - _This makes it easier for the reviewer to see changes without pulling down your branch._
- Add a test.
  - This makes your code even more desirable.
