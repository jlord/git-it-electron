  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <p>Install Git on your computer and configure your name and email.</p>
</div>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Git is <strong>open source software</strong> (free for anyone to use) written
  by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system. </p>
<p>It is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in
  programming as <strong>version control</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step: Install Git</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows</strong>: It's recommended to download GitHub Desktop,
  which includes Git and has an easier install:
  <a href="http://desktop.github.com" target="_blank">desktop.github.com</a>. Use the <strong>Git Shell</strong> for your terminal.</li>

  <li><strong>Mac</strong>: You can also download GitHub Desktop, which includes
  Git, <a href="http://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">desktop.github.com</a> (from Preferences, select
  the command line tools install), or
    <ul>
      <li>download Git by itself at:
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git-scm.com/downloads</a> and follow the installation instructions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Git isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not
see an icon on your desktop, but it will always be available to you
and you'll be able to access it at anytime from your
terminal (which you're using in Git-it!) or Git desktop applications (like GitHub Desktop).</p>

<h2>Step: Configure Git</h2>
<p>Once it is installed, open <strong>terminal</strong> (aka Bash, aka Shell, aka Prompt).
You can verify that it's really there by typing:</p>

<p><code>$ git --version </code></p>

<p>This will return the version of Git that you're running and look something like this:</p>

<p><code>git version 1.9.1</code></p>

<p>(Any version <code>1.7.10</code> or higher is fine.)</p>

<p>Next, configure Git so it knows who to associate your changes to:</p>

<p>Set your name:</p>
<p><code>$ git config --global user.name "&#60;Your Name&#62;"</code></p>
<p>Now set your email:</p>
<p><code>$ git config --global user.email "&#60;youremail@example.com&#62;"</code></p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <p>Dollar signs <code>$</code> are often used in programming documentation
to signify that the line is <strong>command line</strong> code (see the code snippets above). You don't actually
type the <code>$</code> in though, only type what comes after. For instance, to run the verify command above, you're actually going to type <code>git-it verify</code> into terminal.</p>
