  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <p>Submit a Pull Request on the original Patchwork repository.</p>
</div>

<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>When you make changes and improvements to a project you've forked,
  often you'll want to send
  those changes to the maintainer of the original and <strong>request</strong> that
  they <strong>pull</strong> the changes into the original so that everyone can
  benefit from the updates - that's a <strong>pull request</strong>.</p>

<p>We want to add you to the list of workshop finishers, so make
  a <strong>pull request</strong> to the original: <a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork" target="_blank">github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

<h2>Step: Create a pull request</h2>
<p>Visit the original repository you forked on GitHub, in this case
<a href="https://github.com/jlord/patchwork">http://github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>.</p>

<p>Often GitHub will detect if you've pushed a branch to a fork and
display it at the top of the original's website. If you see that with your 'add-username' branch,
you can click Create Pull Request from there. If not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click 'Pull request' on the right-side menu, then 'New pull request'.</li>
  <li>Select the branch with the changes you want to submit. <strong>It should be
the one with 'add-yourusername'</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll now see a page with the details of the pull request you're
in the process of submitting. The page shows the commits and changes
associated with your pull request as compared to the 'gh-pages' branch of the original.</p>

<p>If the original repository has a
<strong>contribution documentation</strong>, GitHub will link to it. This is documentation from repository owners on how to best make contributions to that project. </p>

<p>If everything is good, and as you expect it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click 'Create pull request'</li>
  <li>Add a title and description to the changes you're suggesting the
  original author pull in.</li>
  <li>Click 'Send pull request'!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>High five! You've submitted your pull request, take a few
seconds to bask in the moment.</strong>

<p>If all is well with your pull request, it will be merged within moments. If it's not merged automatically within a few moments, you'll then
likely have some comments from Reporobot on why it couldn't merge
it. If so, close your pull request on GitHub, make the necessary
changes to your branch, push those changes and resubmit your pull
request.</p>
