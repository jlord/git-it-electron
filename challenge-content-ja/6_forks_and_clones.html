  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <p>Fork a project from GitHub.com and clone it locally.</p>
</div>

<h2>Forks</h2>

<p>Now you've made a project locally and pushed it to GitHub, but that's
  only half the fun. The other half is working with other people and
  projects.</p>

<p>When you <strong>fork</strong> a repository, you're creating a copy of it on
  your GitHub account. Your fork begins its life as a <strong>remote</strong> repository. Forks are used for creating your own
  version of a project or contributing back fixes or features to the
  original project. </p>

<p>Once a project is forked, you then <strong>clone</strong> (aka copy) it from
  GitHub to your computer to work on locally.</p>

<h2>Step: Fork Patchwork Repository</h2>
<p>The project we'll work with is <a href="http://github.com/jlord/patchwork" target="_blank">github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>. Go to that site and click the fork button at the top right. Once the
  fork animation is complete, you've got a copy on your account. Copy
  your fork's HTTP URL on the right sidebar.</p>

<h2>Step: Clone Fork Locally</h2>
<p>Now, in terminal, clone the repository onto your computer. It will create a new folder
  for the repository so no need to create one. But make sure you aren't
  cloning it inside of another Git repository folder! So, if you're still
  inside of the 'hello-world' repository you worked in on the earlier challenges,
  back out of that folder. You can leave the folder you're in (and be in the folder that it was inside of) by 'changing directory' with two dots:

<p><code>$ cd ..</code></p>

Now clone:

<p><code>$ git clone &#60;URLFROMGITHUB&#62;</code></p>

<p>Go into the folder for the fork it created (in this case, named 'patchwork')</p>
<p><code>$ cd patchwork</code></p>

<p>Now you've got a copy of the repository on your computer and it is
  automatically connected to the remote repository (your forked copy)
  on your GitHub account.</p>

<h2>Step: Connect to the Original Repository</h2>

<p>But what if the original repository you forked from changes? You'll want
  to be able to <strong>pull</strong> in those changes too. So let's add another remote
  connection, this time to the original, <a href="http://github.com/jlord/patchwork" target="_blank">github.com/jlord/patchwork</a>, repository
  with its URL, found on the right hand side of the original on GitHub.</p>

<p>You can name this remote connection anything you want, but often
  people use 'upstream', let's use that for this.</p>

<p><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/jlord/patchwork.git</code></p>
