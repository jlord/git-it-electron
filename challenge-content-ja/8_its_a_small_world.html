<p>Working with others is one of the best things about GitHub because
  it makes it easy to work from all over the world at any time.</p>

<p><strong>Collaborators</strong> are other GitHub users who are given permission to
  make edits to a repository owned by someone else. To add
  collaborators to a project, visit the repository's GitHub page
  and click the 'Settings' icon on the right side menu. Then select the
  'Collaborators' tab. Type in the username to add and click 'Add'.</p>
