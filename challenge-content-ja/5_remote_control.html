  <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
  <p>Connect your local and remote repositories and push changes.</p>
</div>

<h2>Remotes</h2>

<p>When you put something on GitHub, that copy lives on one of GitHub's servers. This makes it a <strong>remote</strong> repository because it is not on your computer, but on a server, "remote" and somewhere else. By <strong>pushing</strong> your <strong>local</strong> (on your computer)
  changes to it, you keep it up to date.</p>

  <p>Others can always get the
  latest from your project by <strong>pulling</strong> your changes down from the remote (and onto their computer). This is how everyone can work on a project together without needing
  access to your computer where your local copy is stored.</p>

<h2>Step: Create a Remote Repository</h2>
<p>You want to sync your <strong>local</strong> version with one stored on GitHub.com
  called the <strong>remote</strong> version. So first create an empty
  remote repository on GitHub.com.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>, log in, and click the '+' in the top
right to create a new repository.</li>
  <li>Give it a name that matches your local repository's name, 'hello-world', and a short
description.</li>
  <li>Make it public.</li>
  <li>Don't initialize with a README because we already have a file, locally, named
'readme.txt'.</li>
  <li>Leave .gitignore and license on 'none'.</li>
  <li>Click create repository!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Readmes, .gitignores and Licenses</h2>
<p>These are common files in open source projects.</p>

<p>A <strong>readme</strong> explains what the project is, how to use it, and often
times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file,
CONTRIBUTING.md, for those details).</p>

<p>A <strong>.gitignore</strong> is a list of files that Git should <em>not</em> track, for instance, files with passwords!</p>

<p>A <strong>license</strong> file is the type of license you put on your project,
information on the types is here:
<a href="http://www.choosealicense.com" target="_blank">choosealicense.com</a>.</p>
<p>We don't need any of them, however, for this example.</p>

<h2>Step: Connect your Local to your Remote</h2>
<p>Now you've got an empty repository started on GitHub.com. At the
top you'll see 'Quick Setup', make sure the 'HTTP' button is
selected and copy the address — this is the location (address) of your
repository on GitHub's servers.</p>

<p>Back in your terminal, and inside of the 'hello-world' folder that you
initialized as a Git repository in the earlier challenge, you
want to tell Git the location of the remote version on GitHub's servers. You can have multiple remotes so each requires a name. For your main one, this is commonly named <code>origin</code>.</p>

<code>$ git remote add origin &lt;URLFROMGITHUB&gt;</code>

<p>Your <strong>local</strong> repository now knows where your <strong>remote</strong> one named 'origin' lives on GitHub's servers. Think of it as adding a name and address on speed dial — now when you need to send something there, you can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note:</strong></p>
<p>If you have <strong>GitHub for Windows</strong> on your computer, a remote
  named 'origin' is automatically created. In that case, you'll
  just need to tell it what URL to associate with origin. Use this
  command instead of the 'add' one above:</p>

<code>$ git remote set-url origin &lt;URLFROMGITHUB&gt;</code>
</blockquote>

<h2>Step: Push Work to your Remote</h2>
<p>Next you want to <strong>push</strong> (send) everything you've done locally
  to GitHub. Ideally you want to stay in sync, meaning your local and remote versions match.</p>

<p>Git has a branching system so that you can work on different
  parts of a project at different times. We'll learn more about that later, but by default the first
  branch is named 'master'. When you push (and later pull) from
  a project, you tell Git the <strong>branch name</strong> you want and the
  name of the <strong>remote</strong> that it lives on.

<p>In this case, we'll send our branch named 'master' to our remote on GitHub named 'origin'. </p>

<code>$ git push origin master</code>

<p>Now go to GitHub and refresh the page of your repository. WOAH!
  Everything is the same locally and remotely. Congrats on your
  first public repository!</p>
