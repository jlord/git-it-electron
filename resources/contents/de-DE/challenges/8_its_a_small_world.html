    <p>Working with others is one of the best things about GitHub because it is easier to work from any place or
        timezone with someone else.</p>

    <p><strong>Collaborators</strong> are other GitHub users who are given permission to make edits to a repository
        owned by someone else. You may also hear the term <strong>contributor</strong>, this describes another GitHub
        user who has made contributions, through a Fork and Pull Request, to a project.</p>

    <h3>Hello, Repo Robot!</h3>
    <p>To add collaborators to one of your projects, visit the repository's page on your GitHub account and click the
        'Settings' tab in the menu in the upper part of the page. Then select the 'Collaborators' option. Type the
        username into the text box add and click 'Add'.</p>

    <p>Go to your forked Patchwork repository's page on GitHub and add 'reporobot' as a collaborator. The URL should
        look like this, but with your username.</p>

    <code>github.com/YOURUSERNAME/patchwork/settings/collaboration</code>
