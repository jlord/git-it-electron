    <h2>Working Better, Together</h2>

    <p>The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share
        and work on with others. No worries, that's what GitHub is for!</p>

    <p>GitHub is a website that allows people everywhere to upload what they're working on with Git so that everyone can
        easily work together on the same project. GitHub which acts as the central repository for you and everyone else
        to share. You push your changes to it and pull down changes from others.</p>

    <h3>SSH Keys and Authentication</h3>
    <p>In order to read and write or sync with the remote repositories, 
        your local git needs to authenticate with the remotes, e.g., GitHub.com.</p>
    <p>Using SSH public/private key pairs is more secure and seamless way to authenticate without using the password.</p>
    <p>Let's configure our local git to authenticate with GitHub.com. You need to do this once per develpment system.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a Terminal and type the command<code class="shell">ssh-keygen</code>. 
            Press enter using suggested default until you get the prompt back. 
            If you see: ... /id_rsa already exits. Overwrite (y/n)? Enter n, we don't wan't to overwrite existing key-pairs.</li>
        <li>
            Copy the public key to clipboard.
            <ul>
                <li><code class="shell">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></li>
                <li>Select and copy (right click) the display contents starting with ssh-rsa ... to the end. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Paste the public key on GitHub.com (login)->Click your profile avatar->Settings->SSh and GPG keys->New SSH key.
            Give it an appropriate Title such as Windows 11 and paste into the Key textbox and Add SSH key.
        </li>
        <li>Test the authentication: <code class="shell">ssh -T git@github.com</code>. 
            If you see: <em>Hi &lt;your_github_username&gt;! You've successfully authenticated, ...</em><strong>Awesome. You're on a roll</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Add GitHub username to Git</h3>
    <p>Add your GitHub username to your Git configuration. We'll do this just for the sake of Git-it; it makes it easier
        to verify the upcoming challenges. Save it exactly as you created it on GitHub and <strong>capitalize where
            capitalized</strong>. Note, you don't need to enter the "&#60;" and "&#62;".</p>

    <p>Add your GitHub username to your Git configuration:</p>
    <code class="shell">git config --global user.username &#60;UserName&#62;</code>

    <p>You can double check what you have set in your Git config by typing:</p>
    <code class="shell">git config --global user.username</code>
</div>

{{{ verify_button }}}

<div class="chal-tip grey-border border-box">
    <p>Make sure you type "<strong>user.username</strong>" above and not "user.name", which would override the name you
        set in the first challenge and leave you with no username property! If you found you did that, it's ok, just
        repeat the step in the first challenge to add your name and then complete the step above.</p>
</div>

<div class="chal-no-pass grey-border border-box">
    <h4>GitHub & Git config usernames do not match</h4>

    <p>A common error is not having your GitHub username match the case of the one you set with <code>git config</code>.
        For instance, 'JLord' isn't the same as 'jlord'</p>
    <p>To change your username set with Git, just do the same command you did earlier, but with the correct
        capitalization:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.username &#60;UserName&#62;</code></p>
    <p>When you've made your updates, verify again!</p>
