read this manual.</p><p>The best way to get one is by using the linkgit:git-clone[1] command to
download a copy of an existing repository.  If you don’t already have a
project in mind, here are some interesting examples:</p><pre class="screen">	# Git itself (approx. 40MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
	# the Linux kernel (approx. 640MB download):
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git</pre><p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you
will only need to clone once.</p><p>The clone command creates a new directory named after the project
(<code class="literal">git</code> or <code class="literal">linux</code> in the examples above).  After you cd into this
directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files,
called the <a class="link" href="#def_working_tree">working tree</a>, together with a special
top-level directory named <code class="literal">.git</code>, which contains all the information
about the history of the project.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="how-to-check-out"></a>Chapter 2. How to check out a different version of a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a collection
of files.  It stores the history as a compressed collection of
interrelated snapshots of the project’s contents.  In Git each such
version is called a <a class="link" href="#def_commit">commit</a>.</p><p>Those snapshots aren’t necessarily all arranged in a single line from
oldest to newest; instead, work may simultaneously proceed along
parallel lines of development, called <a class="link" href="#def_branch">branches</a>, which may
merge and diverge.</p><p>A single Git repository can track development on multiple branches.  It
does this by keeping a list of <a class="link" href="#def_head">heads</a> which reference the
latest commit on each branch; the linkgit:git-branch[1] command shows
you the list of branch heads:</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch
* master</pre><p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch head, by default
named "master", with the working directory initialized to the state of
the project referred to by that branch head.</p><p>Most projects also use <a class="link" href="#def_tag">tags</a>.  Tags, like heads, are
references into the project’s history, and can be listed using the
linkgit:git-tag[1] command:</p><pre class="screen">$ git tag -l
v2.6.11
v2.6.11-tree
v2.6.12
v2.6.12-rc2
v2.6.12-rc3
v2.6.12-rc4
v2.6.12-rc5
v2.6.12-rc6
v2.6.13
...</pre><p>Tags are expected to always point at the same version of a project,
while heads are expected to advance as development progresses.</p><p>Create a new branch head pointing to one of these versions and check it
out using linkgit:git-checkout[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout -b new v2.6.13</pre><p>The working directory then reflects the contents that the project had
when it was tagged v2.6.13, and linkgit:git-branch[1] shows two
branches, with an asterisk marking the currently checked-out branch:</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch
  master
* new</pre><p>If you decide that you’d rather see version 2.6.17, you can modify
the current branch to point at v2.6.17 instead, with</p><pre class="screen">$ git reset --hard v2.6.17</pre><p>Note that if the current branch head was your only reference to a
particular point in history, then resetting that branch may leave you
with no way to find the history it used to point to; so use this command
carefully.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="understanding-commits"></a>Chapter 3. Understanding History: Commits</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#understanding-reachability">Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#history-diagrams">Understanding history: History diagrams</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#what-is-a-branch">Understanding history: What is a branch?</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>Every change in the history of a project is represented by a commit.

did, and why.</p><p>Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name" or the
"SHA-1 id", shown on the first line of the <code class="literal">git show</code> output.  You can usually
refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as a tag or a branch name, but this
longer name can also be useful.  Most importantly, it is a globally unique
name for this commit: so if you tell somebody else the object name (for
example in email), then you are guaranteed that name will refer to the same
commit in their repository that it does in yours (assuming their repository
has that commit at all).  Since the object name is computed as a hash over the
contents of the commit, you are guaranteed that the commit can never change
without its name also changing.</p><p>In fact, in <a class="xref" href="#git-concepts" title="Part VII. Git concepts">Part VII, “Git concepts”</a> we shall see that everything stored in Git
history, including file data and directory contents, is stored in an object
with a name that is a hash of its contents.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="understanding-reachability"></a>Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</h2></div></div></div><p>Every commit (except the very first commit in a project) also has a
parent commit which shows what happened before this commit.
Following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the
beginning of the project.</p><p>However, the commits do not form a simple list; Git allows lines of
development to diverge and then reconverge, and the point where two
lines of development reconverge is called a "merge".  The commit
representing a merge can therefore have more than one parent, with
each parent representing the most recent commit on one of the lines
of development leading to that point.</p><p>The best way to see how this works is using the linkgit:gitk[1]
command; running gitk now on a Git repository and looking for merge
commits will help understand how Git organizes history.</p><p>In the following, we say that commit X is "reachable" from commit Y
if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y.  Equivalently, you could say
that Y is a descendant of X, or that there is a chain of parents
leading from commit Y to commit X.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="history-diagrams"></a>Understanding history: History diagrams</h2></div></div></div><p>We will sometimes represent Git history using diagrams like the one
below.  Commits are shown as "o", and the links between them with
lines drawn with - / and \.  Time goes left to right:</p><pre class="literallayout">         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch A
        /
 o--o--o &lt;-- master
        \
         o--o--o &lt;-- Branch B</pre><p>If we need to talk about a particular commit, the character "o" may

of development, and "branch head" (or just "head") to mean a reference
to the most recent commit on a branch.  In the example above, the branch
head named "A" is a pointer to one particular commit, but we refer to
the line of three commits leading up to that point as all being part of
"branch A".</p><p>However, when no confusion will result, we often just use the term
"branch" both for branches and for branch heads.</p></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="manipulating-branches"></a>Chapter 4. Manipulating branches</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here’s

accept an arbitrary commit; for example, you can check out the commit
referenced by a tag:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout v2.6.17
Note: checking out 'v2.6.17'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

HEAD is now at 427abfa... Linux v2.6.17</pre><p>The HEAD then refers to the SHA-1 of the commit instead of to a branch,
and git branch shows that you are no longer on a branch:</p><pre class="screen">$ cat .git/HEAD

$ git branch
* (detached from v2.6.17)
  master</pre><p>In this case we say that the HEAD is "detached".</p><p>This is an easy way to check out a particular version without having to
make up a name for the new branch.   You can still create a new branch
(or tag) for this version later if you decide to.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="examining-remote-branches"></a>Chapter 6. Examining branches from a remote repository</h2></div></div></div><p>The "master" branch that was created at the time you cloned is a copy
of the HEAD in the repository that you cloned from.  That repository
may also have had other branches, though, and your local repository
keeps branches which track each of those remote branches, called
remote-tracking branches, which you
can view using the <code class="literal">-r</code> option to linkgit:git-branch[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch -r
  origin/HEAD
  origin/html
  origin/maint
  origin/man
  origin/master
  origin/next
  origin/pu
  origin/todo</pre><p>In this example, "origin" is called a remote repository, or "remote"
for short. The branches of this repository are called "remote
branches" from our point of view. The remote-tracking branches listed
above were created based on the remote branches at clone time and will
be updated by <code class="literal">git fetch</code> (hence <code class="literal">git pull</code>) and <code class="literal">git push</code>. See
<a class="xref" href="#Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch" title="Chapter 8. Updating a repository with git fetch">Chapter 8, <i>Updating a repository with git fetch</i></a> for details.</p><p>You might want to build on one of these remote-tracking branches
on a branch of your own, just as you would for a tag:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout -b my-todo-copy origin/todo</pre><p>You can also check out <code class="literal">origin/todo</code> directly to examine it or
write a one-off patch.  See <a class="link" href="#detached-head" title="Chapter 5. Examining an old version without creating a new branch">detached head</a>.</p><p>Note that the name "origin" is just the name that Git uses by default

commits.  All references are named with a slash-separated path name
starting with <code class="literal">refs</code>; the names we’ve been using so far are actually
shorthand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">The branch <code class="literal">test</code> is short for <code class="literal">refs/heads/test</code>.</li><li class="listitem">The tag <code class="literal">v2.6.18</code> is short for <code class="literal">refs/tags/v2.6.18</code>.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">origin/master</code> is short for <code class="literal">refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</li></ul></div><p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever
exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p><p>(Newly created refs are actually stored in the <code class="literal">.git/refs</code> directory,
under the path given by their name.  However, for efficiency reasons
they may also be packed together in a single file; see
linkgit:git-pack-refs[1]).</p><p>As another useful shortcut, the "HEAD" of a repository can be referred
to just using the name of that repository.  So, for example, "origin"
is usually a shortcut for the HEAD branch in the repository "origin".</p><p>For the complete list of paths which Git checks for references, and
the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple

"master" crashes.  Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a
regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project’s
history to find the particular commit that caused the problem.  The
linkgit:git-bisect[1] command can help you do this:</p><pre class="screen">$ git bisect start
$ git bisect good v2.6.18
$ git bisect bad master
Bisecting: 3537 revisions left to test after this
[65934a9a028b88e83e2b0f8b36618fe503349f8e] BLOCK: Make USB storage depend on SCSI rather than selecting it [try #6]</pre><p>If you run <code class="literal">git branch</code> at this point, you’ll see that Git has
temporarily moved you in "(no branch)". HEAD is now detached from any
branch and points directly to a commit (with commit id 65934…​) that
is reachable from "master" but not from v2.6.18. Compile and test it,
and see whether it crashes. Assume it does crash. Then:</p><pre class="screen">$ git bisect bad

stage whether the version it gives you is good or bad, and notice
that the number of revisions left to test is cut approximately in
half each time.</p><p>After about 13 tests (in this case), it will output the commit id of
the guilty commit.  You can then examine the commit with
linkgit:git-show[1], find out who wrote it, and mail them your bug
report with the commit id.  Finally, run</p><pre class="screen">$ git bisect reset</pre><p>to return you to the branch you were on before.</p><p>Note that the version which <code class="literal">git bisect</code> checks out for you at each
point is just a suggestion, and you’re free to try a different
version if you think it would be a good idea.  For example,
occasionally you may land on a commit that broke something unrelated;
run</p><pre class="screen">$ git bisect visualize</pre><p>which will run gitk and label the commit it chose with a marker that
says "bisect".  Choose a safe-looking commit nearby, note its commit
id, and check it out with:</p><pre class="screen">$ git reset --hard fb47ddb2db...</pre><p>then test, run <code class="literal">bisect good</code> or <code class="literal">bisect bad</code> as appropriate, and
continue.</p><p>Instead of <code class="literal">git bisect visualize</code> and then <code class="literal">git reset --hard
fb47ddb2db...</code>, you might just want to tell Git that you want to skip
the current commit:</p><pre class="screen">$ git bisect skip</pre><p>In this case, though, Git may not eventually be able to tell the first
bad one between some first skipped commits and a later bad commit.</p><p>There are also ways to automate the bisecting process if you have a
test script that can tell a good from a bad commit. See
linkgit:git-bisect[1] for more information about this and other <code class="literal">git
bisect</code> features.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="naming-commits"></a>Chapter 11. Naming commits</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen several ways of naming commits already:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">40-hexdigit object name</li><li class="listitem">branch name: refers to the commit at the head of the given
branch</li><li class="listitem">tag name: refers to the commit pointed to by the given tag
(we’ve seen branches and tags are special cases of
<a class="link" href="#how-git-stores-references" title="Chapter 7. Naming branches, tags, and other references">references</a>).</li><li class="listitem">HEAD: refers to the head of the current branch</li></ul></div><p>There are many more; see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of the
linkgit:gitrevisions[7] man page for the complete list of ways to
name revisions.  Some examples:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show fb47ddb2 # the first few characters of the object name
		    # are usually enough to specify it uniquely
$ git show HEAD^    # the parent of the HEAD commit
$ git show HEAD^^   # the grandparent
$ git show HEAD~4   # the great-great-grandparent</pre><p>Recall that merge commits may have more than one parent; by default,
<code class="literal">^</code> and <code class="literal">~</code> follow the first parent listed in the commit, but you can
also choose:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show HEAD^1   # show the first parent of HEAD
$ git show HEAD^2   # show the second parent of HEAD</pre><p>In addition to HEAD, there are several other special names for
commits:</p><p>Merges (to be discussed later), as well as operations such as
<code class="literal">git reset</code>, which change the currently checked-out commit, generally
set ORIG_HEAD to the value HEAD had before the current operation.</p><p>The <code class="literal">git fetch</code> operation always stores the head of the last fetched
branch in FETCH_HEAD.  For example, if you run <code class="literal">git fetch</code> without
specifying a local branch as the target of the operation</p><pre class="screen">$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git theirbranch</pre><p>the fetched commits will still be available from FETCH_HEAD.</p><p>When we discuss merges we’ll also see the special name MERGE_HEAD,
which refers to the other branch that we’re merging in to the current
branch.</p><p>The linkgit:git-rev-parse[1] command is a low-level command that is
occasionally useful for translating some name for a commit to the object
name for that commit:</p><pre class="screen">$ git rev-parse origin
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b</pre></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="creating-tags"></a>Chapter 12. Creating tags</h2></div></div></div><p>We can also create a tag to refer to a particular commit; after
running</p><pre class="screen">$ git tag stable-1 1b2e1d63ff</pre><p>You can use <code class="literal">stable-1</code> to refer to the commit 1b2e1d63ff.</p><p>This creates a "lightweight" tag.  If you would also like to include a
comment with the tag, and possibly sign it cryptographically, then you
should create a tag object instead; see the linkgit:git-tag[1] man page
for details.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="browsing-revisions"></a>Chapter 13. Browsing revisions</h2></div></div></div><p>The linkgit:git-log[1] command can show lists of commits.  On its
own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you
can also make more specific requests:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log v2.5..	# commits since (not reachable from) v2.5
$ git log test..master	# commits reachable from master but not test
$ git log master..test	# ...reachable from test but not master
$ git log master...test	# ...reachable from either test or master,
			#    but not both
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks
$ git log Makefile      # commits which modify Makefile
$ git log fs/		# ... which modify any file under fs/
$ git log -S'foo()'	# commits which add or remove any file data
			# matching the string 'foo()'</pre><p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds
commits since v2.5 which touch the <code class="literal">Makefile</code> or any file under <code class="literal">fs</code>:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log v2.5.. Makefile fs/</pre><p>You can also ask git log to show patches:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log -p</pre><p>See the <code class="literal">--pretty</code> option in the linkgit:git-log[1] man page for more
display options.</p><p>Note that git log starts with the most recent commit and works
backwards through the parents; however, since Git history can contain
multiple independent lines of development, the particular order that
commits are listed in may be somewhat arbitrary.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="generating-diffs"></a>Chapter 14. Generating diffs</h2></div></div></div><p>You can generate diffs between any two versions using

you’d prefer to find the diff from their common ancestor to test, you
can use three dots instead of two:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff master...test</pre><p>Sometimes what you want instead is a set of patches; for this you can
use linkgit:git-format-patch[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git format-patch master..test</pre><p>will generate a file with a patch for each commit reachable from test

able to view an old version of a single file without checking
anything out; this command does that:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show v2.5:fs/locks.c</pre><p>Before the colon may be anything that names a commit, and after it
may be any path to a file tracked by Git.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="history-examples"></a>Chapter 16. Examples</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#counting-commits-on-a-branch">Counting the number of commits on a branch</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#checking-for-equal-branches">Check whether two branches point at the same history</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#finding-tagged-descendants">Find first tagged version including a given fix</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#showing-commits-unique-to-a-branch">Showing commits unique to a given branch</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#making-a-release">Creating a changelog and tarball for a software release</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#Finding-commits-With-given-Content">Finding commits referencing a file with given content</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="counting-commits-on-a-branch"></a>Counting the number of commits on a branch</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose you want to know how many commits you’ve made on <code class="literal">mybranch</code>

$ git rev-list master
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b</pre><p>Or you could recall that the <code class="literal">...</code> operator selects all commits

both; so</p><pre class="screen">$ git log origin...master</pre><p>will return no commits when the two branches are equal.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="finding-tagged-descendants"></a>Find first tagged version including a given fix</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose you know that the commit e05db0fd fixed a certain problem.
You’d like to find the earliest tagged release that contains that
fix.</p><p>Of course, there may be more than one answer—​if the history branched
after commit e05db0fd, then there could be multiple "earliest" tagged
releases.</p><p>You could just visually inspect the commits since e05db0fd:</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk e05db0fd..</pre><p>or you can use linkgit:git-name-rev[1], which will give the commit a
name based on any tag it finds pointing to one of the commit’s
descendants:</p><pre class="screen">$ git name-rev --tags e05db0fd
e05db0fd tags/v1.5.0-rc1^0~23</pre><p>The linkgit:git-describe[1] command does the opposite, naming the
revision using a tag on which the given commit is based:</p><pre class="screen">$ git describe e05db0fd
v1.5.0-rc0-260-ge05db0f</pre><p>but that may sometimes help you guess which tags might come after the
given commit.</p><p>If you just want to verify whether a given tagged version contains a
given commit, you could use linkgit:git-merge-base[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge-base e05db0fd v1.5.0-rc1
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b</pre><p>The merge-base command finds a common ancestor of the given commits,
and always returns one or the other in the case where one is a
descendant of the other; so the above output shows that e05db0fd
actually is an ancestor of v1.5.0-rc1.</p><p>Alternatively, note that</p><pre class="screen">$ git log v1.5.0-rc1..e05db0fd</pre><p>will produce empty output if and only if v1.5.0-rc1 includes e05db0fd,
because it outputs only commits that are not reachable from v1.5.0-rc1.</p><p>As yet another alternative, the linkgit:git-show-branch[1] command lists
the commits reachable from its arguments with a display on the left-hand
side that indicates which arguments that commit is reachable from.
So, if you run something like</p><pre class="screen">$ git show-branch e05db0fd v1.5.0-rc0 v1.5.0-rc1 v1.5.0-rc2

The easiest way to do so is to use linkgit:git-config[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git config --global user.name 'Your Name Comes Here'
$ git config --global user.email 'you@yourdomain.example.com'</pre><p>Which will add the following to a file named <code class="literal">.gitconfig</code> in your
home directory:</p><pre class="screen">[user]
	name = Your Name Comes Here
	email = you@yourdomain.example.com</pre><p>See the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of linkgit:git-config[1] for
details on the configuration file.  The file is plain text, so you can
also edit it with your favorite editor.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="creating-a-new-repository"></a>Chapter 18. Creating a new repository</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a new repository from scratch is very easy:</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir project
$ cd project
$ git init</pre><p>If you have some initial content (say, a tarball):</p><pre class="screen">$ tar xzvf project.tar.gz
$ cd project
$ git init
$ git add . # include everything below ./ in the first commit:
$ git commit</pre></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="how-to-make-a-commit"></a>Chapter 19. How to make a commit</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating a new commit takes three steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">Making some changes to the working directory using your
favorite editor.</li><li class="listitem">Telling Git about your changes.</li><li class="listitem">Creating the commit using the content you told Git about
in step 2.</li></ol></div><p>In practice, you can interleave and repeat steps 1 and 2 as many
times as you want: in order to keep track of what you want committed
at step 3, Git maintains a snapshot of the tree’s contents in a
special staging area called "the index."</p><p>At the beginning, the content of the index will be identical to
that of the HEAD.  The command <code class="literal">git diff --cached</code>, which shows
the difference between the HEAD and the index, should therefore
produce no output at that point.</p><p>Modifying the index is easy:</p><p>To update the index with the contents of a new or modified file, use</p><pre class="screen">$ git add path/to/file</pre><p>To remove a file from the index and from the working tree, use</p><pre class="screen">$ git rm path/to/file</pre><p>After each step you can verify that</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff --cached</pre><p>always shows the difference between the HEAD and the index file—​this
is what you’d commit if you created the commit now—​and that</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff</pre><p>shows the difference between the working tree and the index file.</p><p>Note that <code class="literal">git add</code> always adds just the current contents of a file
to the index; further changes to the same file will be ignored unless
you run <code class="literal">git add</code> on the file again.</p><p>When you’re ready, just run</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit</pre><p>and Git will prompt you for a commit message and then create the new
commit.  Check to make sure it looks like what you expected with</p><pre class="screen">$ git show</pre><p>As a special shortcut,</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit -a</pre><p>will update the index with any files that you’ve modified or removed
and create a commit, all in one step.</p><p>A number of commands are useful for keeping track of what you’re
about to commit:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff --cached # difference between HEAD and the index; what
		    # would be committed if you ran "commit" now.
$ git diff	    # difference between the index file and your
		    # working directory; changes that would not
		    # be included if you ran "commit" now.
$ git diff HEAD	    # difference between HEAD and working tree; what
		    # would be committed if you ran "commit -a" now.
$ git status	    # a brief per-file summary of the above.</pre><p>You can also use linkgit:git-gui[1] to create commits, view changes in
the index and the working tree files, and individually select diff hunks
for inclusion in the index (by right-clicking on the diff hunk and
choosing "Stage Hunk For Commit").</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="creating-good-commit-messages"></a>Chapter 20. Creating good commit messages</h2></div></div></div><p>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message
with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the
change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough
description.  The text up to the first blank line in a commit
message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used
throughout Git.  For example, linkgit:git-format-patch[1] turns a
commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the
rest of the commit in the body.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="ignoring-files"></a>Chapter 21. Ignoring files</h2></div></div></div><p>A project will often generate files that you do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> want to track with Git.
This typically includes files generated by a build process or temporary
backup files made by your editor. Of course, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> tracking files with Git
is just a matter of <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> calling <code class="literal">git add</code> on them. But it quickly becomes
annoying to have these untracked files lying around; e.g. they make
<code class="literal">git add .</code> practically useless, and they keep showing up in the output of
<code class="literal">git status</code>.</p><p>You can tell Git to ignore certain files by creating a file called
<code class="literal">.gitignore</code> in the top level of your working directory, with contents
such as:</p><pre class="screen"># Lines starting with '#' are considered comments.
# Ignore any file named foo.txt.
foo.txt
# Ignore (generated) html files,
*.html
# except foo.html which is maintained by hand.
!foo.html
# Ignore objects and archives.
*.[oa]</pre><p>See linkgit:gitignore[5] for a detailed explanation of the syntax.  You can
also place .gitignore files in other directories in your working tree, and they
will apply to those directories and their subdirectories.  The <code class="literal">.gitignore</code>
files can be added to your repository like any other files (just run <code class="literal">git add
.gitignore</code> and <code class="literal">git commit</code>, as usual), which is convenient when the exclude
patterns (such as patterns matching build output files) would also make sense
for other users who clone your repository.</p><p>If you wish the exclude patterns to affect only certain repositories
(instead of every repository for a given project), you may instead put
them in a file in your repository named <code class="literal">.git/info/exclude</code>, or in any
file specified by the <code class="literal">core.excludesFile</code> configuration variable.
Some Git commands can also take exclude patterns directly on the
command line.  See linkgit:gitignore[5] for the details.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="how-to-merge"></a>Chapter 22. How to merge</h2></div></div></div><p>You can rejoin two diverging branches of development using
linkgit:git-merge[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge branchname</pre><p>merges the development in the branch <code class="literal">branchname</code> into the current
branch.</p><p>A merge is made by combining the changes made in <code class="literal">branchname</code> and the
changes made up to the latest commit in your current branch since
their histories forked. The work tree is overwritten by the result of
the merge when this combining is done cleanly, or overwritten by a
half-merged results when this combining results in conflicts.
Therefore, if you have uncommitted changes touching the same files as
the ones impacted by the merge, Git will refuse to proceed. Most of
the time, you will want to commit your changes before you can merge,
and if you don’t, then linkgit:git-stash[1] can take these changes
away while you’re doing the merge, and reapply them afterwards.</p><p>If the changes are independent enough, Git will automatically complete
the merge and commit the result (or reuse an existing commit in case
of <a class="link" href="#fast-forwards" title="Chapter 25. Fast-forward merges">fast-forward</a>, see below). On the other hand,
if there are conflicts—​for example, if the same file is
modified in two different ways in the remote branch and the local
branch—​then you are warned; the output may look something like this:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge next
 100% (4/4) done
Auto-merged file.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre><p>Conflict markers are left in the problematic files, and after
you resolve the conflicts manually, you can update the index
with the contents and run Git commit, as you normally would when
creating a new file.</p><p>If you examine the resulting commit using gitk, you will see that it
has two parents, one pointing to the top of the current branch, and
one to the top of the other branch.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="resolving-a-merge"></a>Chapter 23. Resolving a merge</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#conflict-resolution">Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>When a merge isn’t resolved automatically, Git leaves the index and
the working tree in a special state that gives you all the
information you need to help resolve the merge.</p><p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you
resolve the problem and update the index, linkgit:git-commit[1] will
fail:</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit
file.txt: needs merge</pre><p>Also, linkgit:git-status[1] will list those files as "unmerged", and the
files with conflicts will have conflict markers added, like this:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file.txt
Hello world
=======
Goodbye
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt</pre><p>All you need to do is edit the files to resolve the conflicts, and then</p><pre class="screen">$ git add file.txt
$ git commit</pre><p>Note that the commit message will already be filled in for you with
some information about the merge.  Normally you can just use this
default message unchanged, but you may add additional commentary of
your own if desired.</p><p>The above is all you need to know to resolve a simple merge.  But Git
also provides more information to help resolve conflicts:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="conflict-resolution"></a>Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge</h2></div></div></div><p>All of the changes that Git was able to merge automatically are
already added to the index file, so linkgit:git-diff[1] shows only
the conflicts.  It uses an unusual syntax:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff
diff --cc file.txt
index 802992c,2b60207..0000000
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@@ -1,1 -1,1 +1,5 @@@
++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:file.txt
 +Hello world
++=======
+ Goodbye
++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt</pre><p>Recall that the commit which will be committed after we resolve this
conflict will have two parents instead of the usual one: one parent
will be HEAD, the tip of the current branch; the other will be the
tip of the other branch, which is stored temporarily in MERGE_HEAD.</p><p>During the merge, the index holds three versions of each file.  Each of
these three "file stages" represents a different version of the file:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show :1:file.txt	# the file in a common ancestor of both branches
$ git show :2:file.txt	# the version from HEAD.
$ git show :3:file.txt	# the version from MERGE_HEAD.</pre><p>When you ask linkgit:git-diff[1] to show the conflicts, it runs a
three-way diff between the conflicted merge results in the work tree with
stages 2 and 3 to show only hunks whose contents come from both sides,
mixed (in other words, when a hunk’s merge results come only from stage 2,
that part is not conflicting and is not shown.  Same for stage 3).</p><p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version of
file.txt and the stage 2 and stage 3 versions.  So instead of preceding
each line by a single <code class="literal">+</code> or <code class="literal">-</code>, it now uses two columns: the first
column is used for differences between the first parent and the working
directory copy, and the second for differences between the second parent
and the working directory copy.  (See the "COMBINED DIFF FORMAT" section
of linkgit:git-diff-files[1] for a details of the format.)</p><p>After resolving the conflict in the obvious way (but before updating the
index), the diff will look like:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff
diff --cc file.txt
index 802992c,2b60207..0000000
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@@ -1,1 -1,1 +1,1 @@@
- Hello world
 -Goodbye
++Goodbye world</pre><p>This shows that our resolved version deleted "Hello world" from the
first parent, deleted "Goodbye" from the second parent, and added
"Goodbye world", which was previously absent from both.</p><p>Some special diff options allow diffing the working directory against
any of these stages:</p><pre class="screen">$ git diff -1 file.txt		# diff against stage 1
$ git diff --base file.txt	# same as the above
$ git diff -2 file.txt		# diff against stage 2
$ git diff --ours file.txt	# same as the above
$ git diff -3 file.txt		# diff against stage 3
$ git diff --theirs file.txt	# same as the above.</pre><p>The linkgit:git-log[1] and linkgit:gitk[1] commands also provide special help
for merges:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log --merge
$ gitk --merge</pre><p>These will display all commits which exist only on HEAD or on
MERGE_HEAD, and which touch an unmerged file.</p><p>You may also use linkgit:git-mergetool[1], which lets you merge the
unmerged files using external tools such as Emacs or kdiff3.</p><p>Each time you resolve the conflicts in a file and update the index:</p><pre class="screen">$ git add file.txt</pre><p>the different stages of that file will be "collapsed", after which
<code class="literal">git diff</code> will (by default) no longer show diffs for that file.</p></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="undoing-a-merge"></a>Chapter 24. Undoing a merge</h2></div></div></div><p>If you get stuck and decide to just give up and throw the whole mess

commit present in the one is already contained in the other—​then Git
just performs a "fast-forward"; the head of the current branch is moved

previous values of each branch.  So in this case you can still find the
old history using, for example,</p><pre class="screen">$ git log master@{1}</pre><p>This lists the commits reachable from the previous version of the
<code class="literal">master</code> branch head.  This syntax can be used with any Git command
that accepts a commit, not just with <code class="literal">git log</code>.  Some other examples:</p><pre class="screen">$ git show master@{2}		# See where the branch pointed 2,
$ git show master@{3}		# 3, ... changes ago.
$ gitk master@{yesterday}	# See where it pointed yesterday,
$ gitk master@{"1 week ago"}	# ... or last week
$ git log --walk-reflogs master	# show reflog entries for master</pre><p>A separate reflog is kept for the HEAD, so</p><pre class="screen">$ git show HEAD@{"1 week ago"}</pre><p>will show what HEAD pointed to one week ago, not what the current branch
pointed to one week ago.  This allows you to see the history of what
you’ve checked out.</p><p>The reflogs are kept by default for 30 days, after which they may be
pruned.  See linkgit:git-reflog[1] and linkgit:git-gc[1] to learn
how to control this pruning, and see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS"
section of linkgit:gitrevisions[7] for details.</p><p>Note that the reflog history is very different from normal Git history.
While normal history is shared by every repository that works on the

may wish to check the original repository for updates and merge them
into your own work.</p><p>We have already seen <a class="link" href="#Updating-a-repository-With-git-fetch" title="Chapter 8. Updating a repository with git fetch">how to
keep remote-tracking branches up to date</a> with linkgit:git-fetch[1],
and how to merge two branches.  So you can merge in changes from the
original repository’s master branch with:</p><pre class="screen">$ git fetch
$ git merge origin/master</pre><p>However, the linkgit:git-pull[1] command provides a way to do this in
one step:</p><pre class="screen">$ git pull origin master</pre><p>In fact, if you have <code class="literal">master</code> checked out, then this branch has been
configured by <code class="literal">git clone</code> to get changes from the HEAD branch of the
origin repository.  So often you can
accomplish the above with just a simple</p><pre class="screen">$ git pull</pre><p>This command will fetch changes from the remote branches to your
remote-tracking branches <code class="literal">origin/*</code>, and merge the default branch into
the current branch.</p><p>More generally, a branch that is created from a remote-tracking branch
will pull
by default from that branch.  See the descriptions of the
<code class="literal">branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code> and <code class="literal">branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code> options in
linkgit:git-config[1], and the discussion of the <code class="literal">--track</code> option in
linkgit:git-checkout[1], to learn how to control these defaults.</p><p>In addition to saving you keystrokes, <code class="literal">git pull</code> also helps you by
producing a default commit message documenting the branch and
repository that you pulled from.</p><p>(But note that no such commit will be created in the case of a
<a class="link" href="#fast-forwards" title="Chapter 25. Fast-forward merges">fast-forward</a>; instead, your branch will just be
updated to point to the latest commit from the upstream branch.)</p><p>The <code class="literal">git pull</code> command can also be given <code class="literal">.</code> as the "remote" repository,
in which case it just merges in a branch from the current repository; so
the commands</p><pre class="screen">$ git pull . branch

just be to send them as patches in email:</p><p>First, use linkgit:git-format-patch[1]; for example:</p><pre class="screen">$ git format-patch origin</pre><p>will produce a numbered series of files in the current directory, one
for each patch in the current branch but not in <code class="literal">origin/HEAD</code>.</p><p><code class="literal">git format-patch</code> can include an initial "cover letter". You can insert
commentary on individual patches after the three dash line which
<code class="literal">format-patch</code> places after the commit message but before the patch
itself.  If you use <code class="literal">git notes</code> to track your cover letter material,
<code class="literal">git format-patch --notes</code> will include the commit’s notes in a similar
manner.</p><p>You can then import these into your mail client and send them by
hand.  However, if you have a lot to send at once, you may prefer to
use the linkgit:git-send-email[1] script to automate the process.
Consult the mailing list for your project first to determine
their requirements for submitting patches.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="importing-patches"></a>Chapter 31. Importing patches to a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git also provides a tool called linkgit:git-am[1] (am stands for
"apply mailbox"), for importing such an emailed series of patches.
Just save all of the patch-containing messages, in order, into a
single mailbox file, say <code class="literal">patches.mbox</code>, then run</p><pre class="screen">$ git am -3 patches.mbox</pre><p>Git will apply each patch in order; if any conflicts are found, it
will stop, and you can fix the conflicts as described in
"<a class="link" href="#resolving-a-merge" title="Chapter 23. Resolving a merge">Resolving a merge</a>".  (The <code class="literal">-3</code> option tells
Git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and
leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p><p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict
resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p><pre class="screen">$ git am --continue</pre><p>and Git will create the commit for you and continue applying the
remaining patches from the mailbox.</p><p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in
the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each
taken from the message containing each patch.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="public-repositories"></a>Chapter 32. Public Git repositories</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="section"><a href="#setting-up-a-public-repository">Setting up a public repository</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#exporting-via-git">Exporting a Git repository via the Git protocol</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#exporting-via-http">Exporting a git repository via HTTP</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository">Pushing changes to a public repository</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#forcing-push">What to do when a push fails</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository">Setting up a shared repository</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#setting-up-gitweb">Allowing web browsing of a repository</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to tell the maintainer
of that project to pull the changes from your repository using
linkgit:git-pull[1].  In the section "<a class="link" href="#getting-updates-With-git-pull" title="Chapter 29. Getting updates with git pull">Getting updates with <code class="literal">git pull</code></a>" we described this as a way to get
updates from the "main" repository, but it works just as well in the
other direction.</p><p>If you and the maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
you can just pull changes from each other’s repositories directly;
commands that accept repository URLs as arguments will also accept a
local directory name:</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone /path/to/repository
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository</pre><p>or an ssh URL:</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone ssh://yourhost/~you/repository</pre><p>For projects with few developers, or for synchronizing a few private
repositories, this may be all you need.</p><p>However, the more common way to do this is to maintain a separate public
repository (usually on a different host) for others to pull changes
from.  This is usually more convenient, and allows you to cleanly
separate private work in progress from publicly visible work.</p><p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">                      you push
your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo

first create a new clone of the repository and tell <code class="literal">git daemon</code> that it
is meant to be public:</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone --bare ~/proj proj.git
$ touch proj.git/git-daemon-export-ok</pre><p>The resulting directory proj.git contains a "bare" git repository—​it is
just the contents of the <code class="literal">.git</code> directory, without any files checked out
around it.</p><p>Next, copy <code class="literal">proj.git</code> to the server where you plan to host the
public repository.  You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most
convenient.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="exporting-via-git"></a>Exporting a Git repository via the Git protocol</h2></div></div></div><p>This is the preferred method.</p><p>If someone else administers the server, they should tell you what
directory to put the repository in, and what <code class="literal">git://</code> URL it will
appear at.  You can then skip to the section
"<a class="link" href="#pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository" title="Pushing changes to a public repository">Pushing changes to a public

listen on port 9418.  By default, it will allow access to any directory
that looks like a Git directory and contains the magic file
git-daemon-export-ok.  Passing some directory paths as <code class="literal">git daemon</code>
arguments will further restrict the exports to those paths.</p><p>You can also run <code class="literal">git daemon</code> as an inetd service; see the

adjustments to give web clients some extra information they need:</p><pre class="screen">$ mv proj.git /home/you/public_html/proj.git

access, which you will need to update the public repository with the
latest changes created in your private repository.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is using linkgit:git-push[1] and ssh; to
update the remote branch named <code class="literal">master</code> with the latest state of your

<a class="link" href="#def_bare_repository">bare</a> repository.  You can also push to a
repository that has a checked-out working tree, but a push to update the
currently checked-out branch is denied by default to prevent confusion.
See the description of the receive.denyCurrentBranch option
in linkgit:git-config[1] for details.</p><p>As with <code class="literal">git fetch</code>, you may also set up configuration options to
save typing; so, for example:</p><pre class="screen">$ git remote add public-repo ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git</pre><p>adds the following to <code class="literal">.git/config</code>:</p><pre class="screen">[remote "public-repo"]
	url = yourserver.com:proj.git

 local  'refs/heads/master'.
 Maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?
error: failed to push to 'ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git'</pre><p>This can happen, for example, if you:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">use <code class="literal">git reset --hard</code> to remove already-published commits, or</li><li class="listitem">use <code class="literal">git commit --amend</code> to replace already-published commits
(as in <a class="xref" href="#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history">the section called “Fixing a mistake with a new commit”</a>), or</li><li class="listitem">use <code class="literal">git rebase</code> to rebase any already-published commits (as

branch name with a plus sign:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git +master</pre><p>Note the addition of the <code class="literal">+</code> sign.  Alternatively, you can use the
<code class="literal">-f</code> flag to force the remote update, as in:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push -f ssh://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git master</pre><p>Normally whenever a branch head in a public repository is modified, it
is modified to point to a descendant of the commit that it pointed to
before.  By forcing a push in this situation, you break that convention.
(See <a class="xref" href="#problems-With-rewriting-history" title="Chapter 40. Problems with rewriting history">Chapter 40, <i>Problems with rewriting history</i></a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, this is a common practice for people that need a simple
way to publish a work-in-progress patch series, and it is an acceptable
compromise as long as you warn other developers that this is how you
intend to manage the branch.</p><p>It’s also possible for a push to fail in this way when other people have
the right to push to the same repository.  In that case, the correct
solution is to retry the push after first updating your work: either by a
pull, or by a fetch followed by a rebase; see the
<a class="link" href="#setting-up-a-shared-repository" title="Setting up a shared repository">next section</a> and

commonly used in CVS, where several developers with special rights
all push to and pull from a single shared repository.  See
linkgit:gitcvs-migration[7] for instructions on how to
set this up.</p><p>However, while there is nothing wrong with Git’s support for shared
repositories, this mode of operation is not generally recommended,

him a "please pull" request.)</li></ul></div><p>He also uses a set of temporary branches ("topic branches"), each
containing a logical grouping of patches.</p><p>To set this up, first create your work tree by cloning Linus’s public
tree:</p><pre class="screen">$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git work
$ cd work</pre><p>Linus’s tree will be stored in the remote-tracking branch named origin/master,
and can be updated using linkgit:git-fetch[1]; you can track other
public trees using linkgit:git-remote[1] to set up a "remote" and
linkgit:git-fetch[1] to keep them up-to-date; see
<a class="xref" href="#repositories-and-branches" title="Part I. Repositories and Branches">Part I, “Repositories and Branches”</a>.</p><p>Now create the branches in which you are going to work; these start out
at the current tip of origin/master branch, and should be set up (using
the <code class="literal">--track</code> option to linkgit:git-branch[1]) to merge changes in from
Linus by default.</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch --track test origin/master
$ git branch --track release origin/master</pre><p>These can be easily kept up to date using linkgit:git-pull[1].</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout test &amp;&amp; git pull
$ git checkout release &amp;&amp; git pull</pre><p>Important note!  If you have any local changes in these branches, then
this merge will create a commit object in the history (with no local
changes Git will simply do a "fast-forward" merge).  Many people dislike
the "noise" that this creates in the Linux history, so you should avoid
doing this capriciously in the <code class="literal">release</code> branch, as these noisy commits
will become part of the permanent history when you ask Linus to pull
from the release branch.</p><p>A few configuration variables (see linkgit:git-config[1]) can
make it easy to push both branches to your public tree.  (See
<a class="xref" href="#setting-up-a-public-repository" title="Setting up a public repository">the section called “Setting up a public repository”</a>.)</p><pre class="screen">$ cat &gt;&gt; .git/config &lt;&lt;EOF
[remote "mytree"]
	url =  master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aegl/linux.git
	push = release
	push = test
EOF</pre><p>Then you can push both the test and release trees using
linkgit:git-push[1]:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push mytree</pre><p>or push just one of the test and release branches using:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push mytree test</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">$ git push mytree release</pre><p>Now to apply some patches from the community.  Think of a short
snappy name for a branch to hold this patch (or related group of
patches), and create a new branch from a recent stable tag of
Linus’s branch. Picking a stable base for your branch will:
1) help you: by avoiding inclusion of unrelated and perhaps lightly
tested changes
2) help future bug hunters that use <code class="literal">git bisect</code> to find problems</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout -b speed-up-spinlocks v2.6.35</pre><p>Now you apply the patch(es), run some tests, and commit the change(s).  If
the patch is a multi-part series, then you should apply each as a separate
commit to this branch.</p><pre class="screen">$ ... patch ... test  ... commit [ ... patch ... test ... commit ]*</pre><p>When you are happy with the state of this change, you can merge it into the
"test" branch in preparation to make it public:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout test &amp;&amp; git merge speed-up-spinlocks</pre><p>It is unlikely that you would have any conflicts here …​ but you might if you
spent a while on this step and had also pulled new versions from upstream.</p><p>Sometime later when enough time has passed and testing done, you can pull the
same branch into the <code class="literal">release</code> tree ready to go upstream.  This is where you
see the value of keeping each patch (or patch series) in its own branch.  It
means that the patches can be moved into the <code class="literal">release</code> tree in any order.</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout release &amp;&amp; git merge speed-up-spinlocks</pre><p>After a while, you will have a number of branches, and despite the
well chosen names you picked for each of them, you may forget what
they are for, or what status they are in.  To get a reminder of what
changes are in a specific branch, use:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log linux..branchname | git shortlog</pre><p>To see whether it has already been merged into the test or release branches,
use:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log test..branchname</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">$ git log release..branchname</pre><p>(If this branch has not yet been merged, you will see some log entries.
If it has been merged, then there will be no output.)</p><p>Once a patch completes the great cycle (moving from test to release,
then pulled by Linus, and finally coming back into your local
<code class="literal">origin/master</code> branch), the branch for this change is no longer needed.
You detect this when the output from:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log origin..branchname</pre><p>is empty.  At this point the branch can be deleted:</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch -d branchname</pre><p>Some changes are so trivial that it is not necessary to create a separate
branch and then merge into each of the test and release branches.  For
these changes, just apply directly to the <code class="literal">release</code> branch, and then
merge that into the <code class="literal">test</code> branch.</p><p>After pushing your work to <code class="literal">mytree</code>, you can use
linkgit:git-request-pull[1] to prepare a "please pull" request message
to send to Linus:</p><pre class="screen">$ git push mytree
$ git request-pull origin mytree release</pre><p>Here are some of the scripts that simplify all this even further.</p><pre class="screen">==== update script ====

that makes it easy for them to read your changes, verify that they are
correct, and understand why you made each change.</p><p>If you present all of your changes as a single patch (or commit), they
may find that it is too much to digest all at once.</p><p>If you present them with the entire history of your work, complete with
mistakes, corrections, and dead ends, they may be overwhelmed.</p><p>So the ideal is usually to produce a series of patches such that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">Each patch can be applied in order.</li><li class="listitem">Each patch includes a single logical change, together with a

them as patches (in a directory named <code class="literal">.git/rebase-apply</code>), update mywork to

		  a'--b'--c' &lt;-- mywork</pre><p>In the process, it may discover conflicts.  In that case it will stop

to update the index with those contents, and then, instead of
running <code class="literal">git commit</code>, just run</p><pre class="screen">$ git rebase --continue</pre><p>and Git will continue applying the rest of the patches.</p><p>At any point you may use the <code class="literal">--abort</code> option to abort this process and

with merging.  Suppose somebody fetches your branch and merges it into
their branch, with a result something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout"> o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Then suppose you modify the last three commits:</p><pre class="literallayout">	 o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
	/
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin</pre><p>If we examined all this history together in one repository, it will
look like:</p><pre class="literallayout">	 o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
	/
 o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin
        \        \
         t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Git has no way of knowing that the new head is an updated version of
the old head; it treats this situation exactly the same as it would if
two developers had independently done the work on the old and new heads
in parallel.  At this point, if someone attempts to merge the new head
in to their branch, Git will attempt to merge together the two (old and
new) lines of development, instead of trying to replace the old by the
new.  The results are likely to be unexpected.</p><p>You may still choose to publish branches whose history is rewritten,
and it may be useful for others to be able to fetch those branches in
order to examine or test them, but they should not attempt to pull such
branches into their own work.</p><p>For true distributed development that supports proper merging,
published branches should never be rewritten.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="bisect-merges"></a>Chapter 41. Why bisecting merge commits can be harder than bisecting linear history</h2></div></div></div><p>The linkgit:git-bisect[1] command correctly handles history that
includes merge commits.  However, when the commit that it finds is a
merge commit, the user may need to work harder than usual to figure out
why that commit introduced a problem.</p><p>Imagine this history:</p><pre class="literallayout">      ---Z---o---X---...---o---A---C---D
          \                       /
           o---o---Y---...---o---B</pre><p>Suppose that on the upper line of development, the meaning of one
of the functions that exists at Z is changed at commit X.  The
commits from Z leading to A change both the function’s
implementation and all calling sites that exist at Z, as well
as new calling sites they add, to be consistent.  There is no
bug at A.</p><p>Suppose that in the meantime on the lower line of development somebody
adds a new calling site for that function at commit Y.  The
commits from Z leading to B all assume the old semantics of that
function and the callers and the callee are consistent with each
other.  There is no bug at B, either.</p><p>Suppose further that the two development lines merge cleanly at C,
so no conflict resolution is required.</p><p>Nevertheless, the code at C is broken, because the callers added
on the lower line of development have not been converted to the new
semantics introduced on the upper line of development.  So if all
you know is that D is bad, that Z is good, and that
linkgit:git-bisect[1] identifies C as the culprit, how will you
figure out that the problem is due to this change in semantics?</p><p>When the result of a <code class="literal">git bisect</code> is a non-merge commit, you should
normally be able to discover the problem by examining just that commit.
Developers can make this easy by breaking their changes into small
self-contained commits.  That won’t help in the case above, however,
because the problem isn’t obvious from examination of any single
commit; instead, a global view of the development is required.  To
make matters worse, the change in semantics in the problematic
function may be just one small part of the changes in the upper
line of development.</p><p>On the other hand, if instead of merging at C you had rebased the
history between Z to B on top of A, you would have gotten this
linear history:</p><pre class="literallayout">    ---Z---o---X--...---o---A---o---o---Y*--...---o---B*--D*</pre><p>Bisecting between Z and D* would hit a single culprit commit Y*,
and understanding why Y* was broken would probably be easier.</p><p>Partly for this reason, many experienced Git users, even when
working on an otherwise merge-heavy project, keep the history
linear by rebasing against the latest upstream version before
publishing.</p></div></div><div class="part"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="advanced-branch-management"></a>Part VI. Advanced branch management</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="chapter"><a href="#fetching-individual-branches">42.

checks to make sure that the most recent commit on the remote

described in the following section.  However, note that in the

represent the history of a project is stored in objects with such names.

mode, object type, SHA-1 name, and name, sorted by name.  It represents
the contents of a single directory tree.</p><p>The object type may be a blob, representing the contents of a file, or
another tree, representing the contents of a subdirectory.  Since trees
and blobs, like all other objects, are named by the SHA-1 hash of their
contents, two trees have the same SHA-1 name if and only if their
contents (including, recursively, the contents of all subdirectories)
are identical.  This allows Git to quickly determine the differences
between two related tree objects, since it can ignore any entries with
identical object names.</p><p>(Note: in the presence of submodules, trees may also have commits as
entries.  See <a class="xref" href="#submodules" title="Part VIII. Submodules">Part VIII, “Submodules”</a> for documentation.)</p><p>Note that the files all have mode 644 or 755: Git actually only pays

...</pre><p>A "blob" object is nothing but a binary blob of data.  It doesn’t refer
to anything else or have attributes of any kind.</p><p>Since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two files in a
directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the repository)
have the same contents, they will share the same blob object. The object
is totally independent of its location in the directory tree, and
renaming a file does not change the object that file is associated with.</p><p>Note that any tree or blob object can be examined using
linkgit:git-show[1] with the &lt;revision&gt;:&lt;path&gt; syntax.  This can
sometimes be useful for browsing the contents of a tree that is not
currently checked out.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="trust"></a>Trust</h2></div></div></div><p>If you receive the SHA-1 name of a blob from one source, and its contents
from another (possibly untrusted) source, you can still trust that those
contents are correct as long as the SHA-1 name agrees.  This is because
the SHA-1 is designed so that it is infeasible to find different contents
that produce the same hash.</p><p>Similarly, you need only trust the SHA-1 name of a top-level tree object
to trust the contents of the entire directory that it refers to, and if
you receive the SHA-1 name of a commit from a trusted source, then you
can easily verify the entire history of commits reachable through
parents of that commit, and all of those contents of the trees referred
to by those commits.</p><p>So to introduce some real trust in the system, the only thing you need
to do is to digitally sign just <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> special note, which includes the
name of a top-level commit.  Your digital signature shows others
that you trust that commit, and the immutability of the history of
commits tells others that they can trust the whole history.</p><p>In other words, you can easily validate a whole archive by just
sending out a single email that tells the people the name (SHA-1 hash)
of the top commit, and digitally sign that email using something
like GPG/PGP.</p><p>To assist in this, Git also provides the tag object…​</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tag-object"></a>Tag Object</h2></div></div></div><p>A tag object contains an object, object type, tag name, the name of the

6930 objects, 47620 kilobytes</pre><p>The first number is the number of objects which are kept in
individual files.  The second is the amount of space taken up by
those "loose" objects.</p><p>You can save space and make Git faster by moving these loose objects in
to a "pack file", which stores a group of objects in an efficient
compressed format; the details of how pack files are formatted can be
found in <a class="ulink" href="technical/pack-format.html" target="_top">pack format</a>.</p><p>To put the loose objects into a pack, just run git repack:</p><pre class="screen">$ git repack

pack.  This will also remove any unreferenced objects (which may be
created when, for example, you use <code class="literal">git reset</code> to remove a commit).
You can verify that the loose objects are gone by looking at the
<code class="literal">.git/objects</code> directory or by running</p><pre class="screen">$ git count-objects
0 objects, 0 kilobytes</pre><p>Although the object files are gone, any commands that refer to those
objects will work exactly as they did before.</p><p>The linkgit:git-gc[1] command performs packing, pruning, and more for
you, so is normally the only high-level command you need.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dangling-objects"></a>Dangling objects</h2></div></div></div><p>The linkgit:git-fsck[1] command will sometimes complain about dangling
objects.  They are not a problem.</p><p>The most common cause of dangling objects is that you’ve rebased a
branch, or you have pulled from somebody else who rebased a branch—​see
<a class="xref" href="#cleaning-up-history" title="Part V. Rewriting history and maintaining patch series">Part V, “Rewriting history and maintaining patch series”</a>.  In that case, the old head of the original
branch still exists, as does everything it pointed to. The branch
pointer itself just doesn’t, since you replaced it with another one.</p><p>There are also other situations that cause dangling objects. For
example, a "dangling blob" may arise because you did a <code class="literal">git add</code> of a
file, but then, before you actually committed it and made it part of the
bigger picture, you changed something else in that file and committed
that <span class="strong"><strong>updated</strong></span> thing—​the old state that you added originally ends up
not being pointed to by any commit or tree, so it’s now a dangling blob
object.</p><p>Similarly, when the "recursive" merge strategy runs, and finds that
there are criss-cross merges and thus more than one merge base (which is
fairly unusual, but it does happen), it will generate one temporary
midway tree (or possibly even more, if you had lots of criss-crossing
merges and more than two merge bases) as a temporary internal merge
base, and again, those are real objects, but the end result will not end
up pointing to them, so they end up "dangling" in your repository.</p><p>Generally, dangling objects aren’t anything to worry about. They can
even be very useful: if you screw something up, the dangling objects can
be how you recover your old tree (say, you did a rebase, and realized
that you really didn’t want to—​you can look at what dangling objects
you have, and decide to reset your head to some old dangling state).</p><p>For commits, you can just use:</p><pre class="screen">$ gitk &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt; --not --all</pre><p>This asks for all the history reachable from the given commit but not
from any branch, tag, or other reference.  If you decide it’s something
you want, you can always create a new reference to it, e.g.,</p><pre class="screen">$ git branch recovered-branch &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre><p>For blobs and trees, you can’t do the same, but you can still examine
them.  You can just do</p><pre class="screen">$ git show &lt;dangling-blob/tree-sha-goes-here&gt;</pre><p>to show what the contents of the blob were (or, for a tree, basically
what the <code class="literal">ls</code> for that directory was), and that may give you some idea
of what the operation was that left that dangling object.</p><p>Usually, dangling blobs and trees aren’t very interesting. They’re
almost always the result of either being a half-way mergebase (the blob
will often even have the conflict markers from a merge in it, if you
have had conflicting merges that you fixed up by hand), or simply
because you interrupted a <code class="literal">git fetch</code> with ^C or something like that,
leaving <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> of the new objects in the object database, but just
dangling and useless.</p><p>Anyway, once you are sure that you’re not interested in any dangling
state, you can just prune all unreachable objects:</p><pre class="screen">$ git prune</pre><p>and they’ll be gone. (You should only run <code class="literal">git prune</code> on a quiescent
repository—​it’s kind of like doing a filesystem fsck recovery: you
don’t want to do that while the filesystem is mounted.
<code class="literal">git prune</code> is designed not to cause any harm in such cases of concurrent
accesses to a repository but you might receive confusing or scary messages.)</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="recovering-from-repository-corruption"></a>Recovering from repository corruption</h2></div></div></div><p>By design, Git treats data trusted to it with caution.  However, even in
the absence of bugs in Git itself, it is still possible that hardware or
operating system errors could corrupt data.</p><p>The first defense against such problems is backups.  You can back up a
Git directory using clone, or just using cp, tar, or any other backup
mechanism.</p><p>As a last resort, you can search for the corrupted objects and attempt
to replace them by hand.  Back up your repository before attempting this
in case you corrupt things even more in the process.</p><p>We’ll assume that the problem is a single missing or corrupted blob,
which is sometimes a solvable problem.  (Recovering missing trees and
especially commits is <span class="strong"><strong>much</strong></span> harder).</p><p>Before starting, verify that there is corruption, and figure out where
it is with linkgit:git-fsck[1]; this may be time-consuming.</p><p>Assume the output looks like this:</p><pre class="screen">$ git fsck --full --no-dangling

missing blob 4b9458b3786228369c63936db65827de3cc06200</pre><p>Now you know that blob 4b9458b3 is missing, and that the tree 2d9263c6
points to it.  If you could find just one copy of that missing blob
object, possibly in some other repository, you could move it into
<code class="literal">.git/objects/4b/9458b3...</code> and be done.  Suppose you can’t.  You can
still examine the tree that pointed to it with linkgit:git-ls-tree[1],
which might output something like:</p><pre class="screen">$ git ls-tree 2d9263c6d23595e7cb2a21e5ebbb53655278dff8

<code class="literal">myfile</code>.  And chances are you can also identify the directory—​let’s
say it’s in <code class="literal">somedirectory</code>.  If you’re lucky the missing copy might be
the same as the copy you have checked out in your working tree at

"current directory cache" or just the "cache".  It has three important
properties:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">The index contains all the information necessary to generate a single
(uniquely determined) tree object.</p><p class="simpara">For example, running linkgit:git-commit[1] generates this tree object
from the index, stores it in the object database, and uses it as the
tree object associated with the new commit.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">The index enables fast comparisons between the tree object it defines
and the working tree.</p><p class="simpara">It does this by storing some additional data for each entry (such as
the last modified time).  This data is not displayed above, and is not
stored in the created tree object, but it can be used to determine
quickly which files in the working directory differ from what was
stored in the index, and thus save Git from having to read all of the
data from such files to look for changes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">It can efficiently represent information about merge conflicts
between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be
associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that
you can create a three-way merge between them.</p><p class="simpara">We saw in <a class="xref" href="#conflict-resolution" title="Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge">the section called “Getting conflict-resolution help during a merge”</a> that during a merge the index can
store multiple versions of a single file (called "stages").  The third
column in the linkgit:git-ls-files[1] output above is the stage
number, and will take on values other than 0 for files with merge
conflicts.</p></li></ol></div><p>The index is thus a sort of temporary staging area, which is filled with
a tree which you are in the process of working on.</p><p>If you blow the index away entirely, you generally haven’t lost any
information as long as you have the name of the tree that it described.</p></div></div><div class="part"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="submodules"></a>Part VIII. Submodules</h1></div></div></div><div class="partintro"><div></div><p>Large projects are often composed of smaller, self-contained modules.  For
example, an embedded Linux distribution’s source tree would include every
piece of software in the distribution with some local modifications; a movie
player might need to build against a specific, known-working version of a
decompression library; several independent programs might all share the same
build scripts.</p><p>With centralized revision control systems this is often accomplished by
including every module in one single repository.  Developers can check out
all modules or only the modules they need to work with.  They can even modify
files across several modules in a single commit while moving things around
or updating APIs and translations.</p><p>Git does not allow partial checkouts, so duplicating this approach in Git
would force developers to keep a local copy of modules they are not
interested in touching.  Commits in an enormous checkout would be slower
than you’d expect as Git would have to scan every directory for changes.
If modules have a lot of local history, clones would take forever.</p><p>On the plus side, distributed revision control systems can much better
integrate with external sources.  In a centralized model, a single arbitrary
snapshot of the external project is exported from its own revision control
and then imported into the local revision control on a vendor branch.  All
the history is hidden.  With distributed revision control you can clone the
entire external history and much more easily follow development and re-merge
local changes.</p><p>Git’s submodule support allows a repository to contain, as a subdirectory, a
checkout of an external project.  Submodules maintain their own identity;
the submodule support just stores the submodule repository location and
commit ID, so other developers who clone the containing project
("superproject") can easily clone all the submodules at the same revision.
Partial checkouts of the superproject are possible: you can tell Git to
clone none, some or all of the submodules.</p><p>The linkgit:git-submodule[1] command is available since Git 1.5.3.  Users
with Git 1.5.2 can look up the submodule commits in the repository and
manually check them out; earlier versions won’t recognize the submodules at
all.</p><p>To see how submodule support works, create four example
repositories that can be used later as a submodule:</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ for i in a b c d
do
	mkdir $i
	cd $i
	git init
	echo "module $i" &gt; $i.txt
	git add $i.txt
	git commit -m "Initial commit, submodule $i"
	cd ..
done</pre><p>Now create the superproject and add all the submodules:</p><pre class="screen">$ mkdir super
$ cd super

	git submodule add ~/git/$i $i

linkgit:git-checkout[1] and linkgit:git-reset[1] work by moving data
between the working tree, the index, and the object database.  Git
provides low-level operations which perform each of these steps
individually.</p><p>Generally, all Git operations work on the index file. Some operations
work <span class="strong"><strong>purely</strong></span> on the index file (showing the current state of the
index), but most operations move data between the index file and either
the database or the working directory. Thus there are four main
combinations:</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="working-directory-to-index"></a>working directory → index</h2></div></div></div><p>The linkgit:git-update-index[1] command updates the index with
information from the working directory.  You generally update the
index information by just specifying the filename you want to update,
like so:</p><pre class="screen">$ git update-index filename</pre><p>but to avoid common mistakes with filename globbing etc., the command
will not normally add totally new entries or remove old entries,
i.e. it will normally just update existing cache entries.</p><p>To tell Git that yes, you really do realize that certain files no
longer exist, or that new files should be added, you
should use the <code class="literal">--remove</code> and <code class="literal">--add</code> flags respectively.</p><p>NOTE! A <code class="literal">--remove</code> flag does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean that subsequent filenames will
necessarily be removed: if the files still exist in your directory
structure, the index will be updated with their new status, not
removed. The only thing <code class="literal">--remove</code> means is that update-index will be
considering a removed file to be a valid thing, and if the file really
does not exist any more, it will update the index accordingly.</p><p>As a special case, you can also do <code class="literal">git update-index --refresh</code>, which
will refresh the "stat" information of each index to match the current
stat information. It will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> update the object status itself, and
it will only update the fields that are used to quickly test whether
an object still matches its old backing store object.</p><p>The previously introduced linkgit:git-add[1] is just a wrapper for
linkgit:git-update-index[1].</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="index-to-object-database"></a>index → object database</h2></div></div></div><p>You write your current index file to a "tree" object with the program</p><pre class="screen">$ git write-tree</pre><p>that doesn’t come with any options—​it will just write out the
current index into the set of tree objects that describe that state,
and it will return the name of the resulting top-level tree. You can
use that tree to re-generate the index at any time by going in the
other direction:</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="object-database-to-index"></a>object database → index</h2></div></div></div><p>You read a "tree" file from the object database, and use that to
populate (and overwrite—​don’t do this if your index contains any
unsaved state that you might want to restore later!) your current
index.  Normal operation is just</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree &lt;SHA-1 of tree&gt;</pre><p>and your index file will now be equivalent to the tree that you saved
earlier. However, that is only your <span class="emphasis"><em>index</em></span> file: your working
directory contents have not been modified.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="index-to-working-directory"></a>index → working directory</h2></div></div></div><p>You update your working directory from the index by "checking out"
files. This is not a very common operation, since normally you’d just
keep your files updated, and rather than write to your working
directory, you’d tell the index files about the changes in your
working directory (i.e. <code class="literal">git update-index</code>).</p><p>However, if you decide to jump to a new version, or check out somebody
else’s version, or just restore a previous tree, you’d populate your
index file with read-tree, and then you need to check out the result
with</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout-index filename</pre><p>or, if you want to check out all of the index, use <code class="literal">-a</code>.</p><p>NOTE! <code class="literal">git checkout-index</code> normally refuses to overwrite old files, so
if you have an old version of the tree already checked out, you will
need to use the <code class="literal">-f</code> flag (<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the <code class="literal">-a</code> flag or the filename) to
<span class="emphasis"><em>force</em></span> the checkout.</p><p>Finally, there are a few odds and ends which are not purely moving
from one representation to the other:</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tying-it-all-together"></a>Tying it all together</h2></div></div></div><p>To commit a tree you have instantiated with <code class="literal">git write-tree</code>, you’d
create a "commit" object that refers to that tree and the history
behind it—​most notably the "parent" commits that preceded it in
history.</p><p>Normally a "commit" has one parent: the previous state of the tree
before a certain change was made. However, sometimes it can have two
or more parent commits, in which case we call it a "merge", due to the
fact that such a commit brings together ("merges") two or more
previous states represented by other commits.</p><p>In other words, while a "tree" represents a particular directory state
of a working directory, a "commit" represents that state in time,
and explains how we got there.</p><p>You create a commit object by giving it the tree that describes the
state at the time of the commit, and a list of parents:</p><pre class="screen">$ git commit-tree &lt;tree&gt; -p &lt;parent&gt; [(-p &lt;parent2&gt;)...]</pre><p>and then giving the reason for the commit on stdin (either through
redirection from a pipe or file, or by just typing it at the tty).</p><p><code class="literal">git commit-tree</code> will return the name of the object that represents
that commit, and you should save it away for later use. Normally,
you’d commit a new <code class="literal">HEAD</code> state, and while Git doesn’t care where you
save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the
result to the file pointed at by <code class="literal">.git/HEAD</code>, so that we can always see
what the last committed state was.</p><p>Here is a picture that illustrates how various pieces fit together:</p><pre class="screen">                     commit-tree

follow the convention of having the top commit name in <code class="literal">.git/HEAD</code>,
you can do</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file commit HEAD</pre><p>to see what the top commit was.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="merging-multiple-trees"></a>Chapter 52. Merging multiple trees</h2></div></div></div><p>Git can help you perform a three-way merge, which can in turn be
used for a many-way merge by repeating the merge procedure several
times.  The usual situation is that you only do one three-way merge
(reconciling two lines of history) and commit the result, but if
you like to, you can merge several branches in one go.</p><p>To perform a three-way merge, you start with the two commits you
want to merge, find their closest common parent (a third commit),
and compare the trees corresponding to these three commits.</p><p>To get the "base" for the merge, look up the common parent of two
commits:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge-base &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</pre><p>This prints the name of a commit they are both based on. You should
now look up the tree objects of those commits, which you can easily
do with</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file commit &lt;commitname&gt; | head -1</pre><p>since the tree object information is always the first line in a commit
object.</p><p>Once you know the three trees you are going to merge (the one "original"
tree, aka the common tree, and the two "result" trees, aka the branches
you want to merge), you do a "merge" read into the index. This will
complain if it has to throw away your old index contents, so you should
make sure that you’ve committed those—​in fact you would normally
always do a merge against your last commit (which should thus match what
you have in your current index anyway).</p><p>To do the merge, do</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree -m -u &lt;origtree&gt; &lt;yourtree&gt; &lt;targettree&gt;</pre><p>which will do all trivial merge operations for you directly in the
index file, and you can just write the result out with
<code class="literal">git write-tree</code>.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="merging-multiple-trees-2"></a>Chapter 53. Merging multiple trees, continued</h2></div></div></div><p>Sadly, many merges aren’t trivial. If there are files that have
been added, moved or removed, or if both branches have modified the
same file, you will be left with an index tree that contains "merge
entries" in it. Such an index tree can <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> be written out to a tree
object, and you will have to resolve any such merge clashes using
other tools before you can write out the result.</p><p>You can examine such index state with <code class="literal">git ls-files --unmerged</code>
command.  An example:</p><pre class="screen">$ git read-tree -m $orig HEAD $target
$ git ls-files --unmerged
100644 263414f423d0e4d70dae8fe53fa34614ff3e2860 1	hello.c
100644 06fa6a24256dc7e560efa5687fa84b51f0263c3a 2	hello.c
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3	hello.c</pre><p>Each line of the <code class="literal">git ls-files --unmerged</code> output begins with
the blob mode bits, blob SHA-1, <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span>, and the
filename.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span> is Git’s way to say which tree it
came from: stage 1 corresponds to the <code class="literal">$orig</code> tree, stage 2 to
the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> tree, and stage 3 to the <code class="literal">$target</code> tree.</p><p>Earlier we said that trivial merges are done inside
<code class="literal">git read-tree -m</code>.  For example, if the file did not change
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> or <code class="literal">$target</code>, or if the file changed
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> the same way,
obviously the final outcome is what is in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.  What the
above example shows is that file <code class="literal">hello.c</code> was changed from
<code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> in a different way.
You could resolve this by running your favorite 3-way merge
program, e.g.  <code class="literal">diff3</code>, <code class="literal">merge</code>, or Git’s own merge-file, on
the blob objects from these three stages yourself, like this:</p><pre class="screen">$ git cat-file blob 263414f... &gt;hello.c~1
$ git cat-file blob 06fa6a2... &gt;hello.c~2
$ git cat-file blob cc44c73... &gt;hello.c~3
$ git merge-file hello.c~2 hello.c~1 hello.c~3</pre><p>This would leave the merge result in <code class="literal">hello.c~2</code> file, along
with conflict markers if there are conflicts.  After verifying
the merge result makes sense, you can tell Git what the final
merge result for this file is by:</p><pre class="screen">$ mv -f hello.c~2 hello.c
$ git update-index hello.c</pre><p>When a path is in the "unmerged" state, running <code class="literal">git update-index</code> for
that path tells Git to mark the path resolved.</p><p>The above is the description of a Git merge at the lowest level,
to help you understand what conceptually happens under the hood.
In practice, nobody, not even Git itself, runs <code class="literal">git cat-file</code> three times
for this.  There is a <code class="literal">git merge-index</code> program that extracts the
stages to temporary files and calls a "merge" script on it:</p><pre class="screen">$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello.c</pre><p>and that is what higher level <code class="literal">git merge -s resolve</code> is implemented with.</p></div></div><div class="part"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="hacking-git"></a>Part X. Hacking Git</h1></div></div></div><div class="partintro"><div></div><p>This chapter covers internal details of the Git implementation which

format of the object (i.e. how it is used, and how it can refer to other
objects).  There are currently four different object types: "blob",
"tree", "commit", and "tag".</p><p>Regardless of object type, all objects share the following
characteristics: they are all deflated with zlib, and have a header
that not only specifies their type, but also provides size information
about the data in the object.  It’s worth noting that the SHA-1 hash
that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data
plus this header, so <code class="literal">sha1sum</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> does not match the object name
for <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>.</p><p>As a result, the general consistency of an object can always be tested
independently of the contents or the type of the object: all objects can
be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the
file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that
forms a sequence of
<code class="literal">&lt;ascii type without space&gt; + &lt;space&gt; + &lt;ascii decimal size&gt; +
&lt;byte\0&gt; + &lt;binary object data&gt;</code>.</p><p>The structured objects can further have their structure and
connectivity to other objects verified. This is generally done with
the <code class="literal">git fsck</code> program, which generates a full dependency graph
of all objects, and verifies their internal consistency (in addition
to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash).</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="birdview-on-the-source-code"></a>Chapter 55. A birds-eye view of Git’s source code</h2></div></div></div><p>It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Git’s
source code.  This section gives you a little guidance to show where to
start.</p><p>A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit, with:</p><pre class="screen">$ git checkout e83c5163</pre><p>The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything Git has
today, but is small enough to read in one sitting.</p><p>Note that terminology has changed since that revision.  For example, the
README in that revision uses the word "changeset" to describe what we
now call a <a class="link" href="#def_commit_object">commit</a>.</p><p>Also, we do not call it "cache" any more, but rather "index"; however, the
file is still called <code class="literal">cache.h</code>.  Remark: Not much reason to change it now,
especially since there is no good single name for it anyway, because it is
basically <span class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> header file which is included by <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of Git’s C sources.</p><p>If you grasp the ideas in that initial commit, you should check out a
more recent version and skim <code class="literal">cache.h</code>, <code class="literal">object.h</code> and <code class="literal">commit.h</code>.</p><p>In the early days, Git (in the tradition of UNIX) was a bunch of programs
which were extremely simple, and which you used in scripts, piping the
output of one into another. This turned out to be good for initial
development, since it was easier to test new things.  However, recently
many of these parts have become builtins, and some of the core has been
"libified", i.e. put into libgit.a for performance, portability reasons,
and to avoid code duplication.</p><p>By now, you know what the index is (and find the corresponding data
structures in <code class="literal">cache.h</code>), and that there are just a couple of object types
(blobs, trees, commits and tags) which inherit their common structure from
<code class="literal">struct object</code>, which is their first member (and thus, you can cast e.g.
<code class="literal">(struct object *)commit</code> to achieve the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> as <code class="literal">&amp;commit-&gt;object</code>, i.e.
get at the object name and flags).</p><p>Now is a good point to take a break to let this information sink in.</p><p>Next step: get familiar with the object naming.  Read <a class="xref" href="#naming-commits" title="Chapter 11. Naming commits">Chapter 11, <i>Naming commits</i></a>.
There are quite a few ways to name an object (and not only revisions!).
All of these are handled in <code class="literal">sha1_name.c</code>. Just have a quick look at
the function <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code>. A lot of the special handling is done by
functions like <code class="literal">get_sha1_basic()</code> or the likes.</p><p>This is just to get you into the groove for the most libified part of Git:
the revision walker.</p><p>Basically, the initial version of <code class="literal">git log</code> was a shell script:</p><pre class="screen">$ git-rev-list --pretty $(git-rev-parse --default HEAD "$@") | \
	LESS=-S ${PAGER:-less}</pre><p>What does this mean?</p><p><code class="literal">git rev-list</code> is the original version of the revision walker, which
<span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> printed a list of revisions to stdout.  It is still functional,
and needs to, since most new Git commands start out as scripts using
<code class="literal">git rev-list</code>.</p><p><code class="literal">git rev-parse</code> is not as important any more; it was only used to filter out
options that were relevant for the different plumbing commands that were
called by the script.</p><p>Most of what <code class="literal">git rev-list</code> did is contained in <code class="literal">revision.c</code> and
<code class="literal">revision.h</code>.  It wraps the options in a struct named <code class="literal">rev_info</code>, which
controls how and what revisions are walked, and more.</p><p>The original job of <code class="literal">git rev-parse</code> is now taken by the function
<code class="literal">setup_revisions()</code>, which parses the revisions and the common command-line
options for the revision walker. This information is stored in the struct
<code class="literal">rev_info</code> for later consumption. You can do your own command-line option
parsing after calling <code class="literal">setup_revisions()</code>. After that, you have to call
<code class="literal">prepare_revision_walk()</code> for initialization, and then you can get the
commits one by one with the function <code class="literal">get_revision()</code>.</p><p>If you are interested in more details of the revision walking process,
just have a look at the first implementation of <code class="literal">cmd_log()</code>; call
<code class="literal">git show v1.3.0~155^2~4</code> and scroll down to that function (note that you
no longer need to call <code class="literal">setup_pager()</code> directly).</p><p>Nowadays, <code class="literal">git log</code> is a builtin, which means that it is <span class="emphasis"><em>contained</em></span> in the
command <code class="literal">git</code>.  The source side of a builtin is</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">a function called <code class="literal">cmd_&lt;bla&gt;</code>, typically defined in <code class="literal">builtin/&lt;bla.c&gt;</code>
(note that older versions of Git used to have it in <code class="literal">builtin-&lt;bla&gt;.c</code>
instead), and declared in <code class="literal">builtin.h</code>.</li><li class="listitem">an entry in the <code class="literal">commands[]</code> array in <code class="literal">git.c</code>, and</li><li class="listitem">an entry in <code class="literal">BUILTIN_OBJECTS</code> in the <code class="literal">Makefile</code>.</li></ul></div><p>Sometimes, more than one builtin is contained in one source file.  For
example, <code class="literal">cmd_whatchanged()</code> and <code class="literal">cmd_log()</code> both reside in <code class="literal">builtin/log.c</code>,
since they share quite a bit of code.  In that case, the commands which are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> named like the <code class="literal">.c</code> file in which they live have to be listed in
<code class="literal">BUILT_INS</code> in the <code class="literal">Makefile</code>.</p><p><code class="literal">git log</code> looks more complicated in C than it does in the original script,
but that allows for a much greater flexibility and performance.</p><p>Here again it is a good point to take a pause.</p><p>Lesson three is: study the code.  Really, it is the best way to learn about
the organization of Git (after you know the basic concepts).</p><p>So, think about something which you are interested in, say, "how can I
access a blob just knowing the object name of it?".  The first step is to
find a Git command with which you can do it.  In this example, it is either
<code class="literal">git show</code> or <code class="literal">git cat-file</code>.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, let’s stay with <code class="literal">git cat-file</code>, because it</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">is plumbing, and</li><li class="listitem">was around even in the initial commit (it literally went only through
some 20 revisions as <code class="literal">cat-file.c</code>, was renamed to <code class="literal">builtin/cat-file.c</code>
when made a builtin, and then saw less than 10 versions).</li></ul></div><p>So, look into <code class="literal">builtin/cat-file.c</code>, search for <code class="literal">cmd_cat_file()</code> and look what
it does.</p><pre class="screen">        git_config(git_default_config);
        if (argc != 3)
		usage("git cat-file [-t|-s|-e|-p|&lt;type&gt;] &lt;sha1&gt;");
        if (get_sha1(argv[2], sha1))
                die("Not a valid object name %s", argv[2]);</pre><p>Let’s skip over the obvious details; the only really interesting part
here is the call to <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code>.  It tries to interpret <code class="literal">argv[2]</code> as an
object name, and if it refers to an object which is present in the current
repository, it writes the resulting SHA-1 into the variable <code class="literal">sha1</code>.</p><p>Two things are interesting here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">get_sha1()</code> returns 0 on <span class="emphasis"><em>success</em></span>.  This might surprise some new
Git hackers, but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different
negative numbers in case of different errors—​and 0 on success.</li><li class="listitem">the variable <code class="literal">sha1</code> in the function signature of <code class="literal">get_sha1()</code> is <code class="literal">unsigned
char *</code>, but is actually expected to be a pointer to <code class="literal">unsigned
char[20]</code>.  This variable will contain the 160-bit SHA-1 of the given
commit.  Note that whenever a SHA-1 is passed as <code class="literal">unsigned char *</code>, it
is the binary representation, as opposed to the ASCII representation in
hex characters, which is passed as <code class="literal">char *</code>.</li></ul></div><p>You will see both of these things throughout the code.</p><p>Now, for the meat:</p><pre class="screen">        case 0:
                buf = read_object_with_reference(sha1, argv[1], &amp;size, NULL);</pre><p>This is how you read a blob (actually, not only a blob, but any type of
object).  To know how the function <code class="literal">read_object_with_reference()</code> actually
works, find the source code for it (something like <code class="literal">git grep
read_object_with | grep ":[a-z]"</code> in the Git repository), and read
the source.</p><p>To find out how the result can be used, just read on in <code class="literal">cmd_cat_file()</code>:</p><pre class="screen">        write_or_die(1, buf, size);</pre><p>Sometimes, you do not know where to look for a feature.  In many such cases,
it helps to search through the output of <code class="literal">git log</code>, and then <code class="literal">git show</code> the
corresponding commit.</p><p>Example: If you know that there was some test case for <code class="literal">git bundle</code>, but
do not remember where it was (yes, you <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> <code class="literal">git grep bundle t/</code>, but that
does not illustrate the point!):</p><pre class="screen">$ git log --no-merges t/</pre><p>In the pager (<code class="literal">less</code>), just search for "bundle", go a few lines back,
and see that it is in commit 18449ab0…​  Now just copy this object name,
and paste it into the command line</p><pre class="screen">$ git show 18449ab0</pre><p>Voila.</p><p>Another example: Find out what to do in order to make some script a
builtin:</p><pre class="screen">$ git log --no-merges --diff-filter=A builtin/*.c</pre><p>You see, Git is actually the best tool to find out about the source of Git
itself!</p></div></div><div class="part"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="glossary"></a>Part XI. Git Glossary</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="chapter"><a href="#git-explained">56.
