=head1 NAME

cpan - easily interact with CPAN from the command line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# with arguments and no switches, installs specified modules
	cpan module_name [ module_name ... ]

	# with switches, installs modules with extra behavior
	cpan [-cfgimtTw] module_name [ module_name ... ]

	# with just the dot, install from the distribution in the
	# current directory
	cpan .

	# without arguments, starts CPAN.pm shell
	cpan

	# force install modules (usually those that fail tests)
	cpan -f module_name [ module_name ... ]

	# install modules but without testing them
	cpan -T module_name [ module_name ... ]

	# dump the configuration
	cpan -J

	# load a different configuration to install Module::Foo
	cpan -j some/other/file Module::Foo

	# without arguments, but some switches
	cpan [-ahrvACDlLO]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script provides a command interface (not a shell) to CPAN. At the
moment it uses CPAN.pm to do the work, but it is not a one-shot command
runner for CPAN.pm.

=head2 Options

=over 4

=item -a

Creates a CPAN.pm autobundle with CPAN::Shell->autobundle.

=item -A module [ module ... ]

Shows the primary maintainers for the specified modules.

=item -c module

Runs a `make clean` in the specified module's directories.

=item -C module [ module ... ]

Show the F<Changes> files for the specified modules

=item -D module [ module ... ]

Show the module details.

=item -f

Force the specified action, when it normally would have failed. Use this
to install a module even if its tests fail. When you use this option,
-i is not optional for installing a module when you need to force it:

	% cpan -f -i Module::Foo

=item -F

Turn off CPAN.pm's attempts to lock anything. You should be careful with
this since you might end up with multiple scripts trying to muck in the
same directory. This isn't so much of a concern if you're loading a special
config with C<-j>, and that config sets up its own work directories.

=item -g module [ module ... ]

Downloads to the current directory the latest distribution of the module.

=item -G module [ module ... ]

UNIMPLEMENTED

Download to the current directory the latest distribution of the
modules, unpack each distribution, and create a git repository for each
distribution.

If you want this feature, check out Yanick Champoux's C<Git::CPAN::Patch>
distribution.

=item -h

Print a help message and exit. When you specify C<-h>, it ignores all
of the other options and arguments.

=item -i

Install the specified modules.

=item -I

Load C<local::lib> (think like C<-I> for loading lib paths).

=item -j Config.pm

Load the file that has the CPAN configuration data. This should have the
same format as the standard F<CPAN/Config.pm> file, which defines
C<$CPAN::Config> as an anonymous hash.

=item -J

Dump the configuration in the same format that CPAN.pm uses. This is useful
for checking the configuration as well as using the dump as a starting point
for a new, custom configuration.

=item -l

List all installed modules with their versions

=item -L author [ author ... ]

List the modules by the specified authors.

=item -m

Make the specified modules.

=item -O

Show the out-of-date modules.

=item -p

Ping the configured mirrors

=item -P

Find the best mirrors you could be using (but doesn't configure them just yet)

=item -r

Recompiles dynamically loaded modules with CPAN::Shell->recompile.

=item -t

Run a `make test` on the specified modules.

=item -T

Do not test modules. Simply install them.

=item -u

Upgrade all installed modules. Blindly doing this can really break things,
so keep a backup.

=item -v

Print the script version and CPAN.pm version then exit.

=item -V

Print detailed information about the cpan client.

=item -w

UNIMPLEMENTED

Turn on cpan warnings. This checks various things, like directory permissions,
and tells you about problems you might have.

=back

=head2 Examples

	# print a help message
	cpan -h

	# print the version numbers
	cpan -v

	# create an autobundle
	cpan -a

	# recompile modules
	cpan -r

	# upgrade all installed modules
	cpan -u

	# install modules ( sole -i is optional )
	cpan -i Netscape::Booksmarks Business::ISBN

	# force install modules ( must use -i )
	cpan -fi CGI::Minimal URI

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over 4

There are several components in CPAN.pm that use environment variables.
The build tools, L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> and L<Module::Build> use some,
while others matter to the levels above them. Some of these are specified
by the Perl Toolchain Gang:

Lancaster Concensus: L<https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/lancaster-consensus.md>

Oslo Concensus: L<https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/toolchain-site/blob/master/oslo-consensus.md>

=over 4

=item CPAN_OPTS

C<cpan> splits this variable on whitespace and prepends that list to C<@ARGV>
before it processes the command-line arguments. For instance, if you always
want to use C<local:lib>, you can set C<CPAN_OPTS> to C<-I>.

=item CPANSCRIPT_LOGLEVEL

The log level to use, with either the embedded, minimal logger or
L<Log::Log4perl> if it is installed. Possible values are the same as
the C<Log::Log4perl> levels: C<TRACE>, C<DEBUG>, C<INFO>, C<WARN>,
C<ERROR>, and C<FATAL>. The default is C<INFO>.

=item GIT_COMMAND

The path to the C<git> binary to use for the Git features. The default
is C</usr/local/bin/git>.

=item NONINTERACTIVE_TESTING

Assume no one is paying attention and skips prompts for distributions
that do that correctly. C<cpan(1)> sets this to C<1> unless it already
has a value (even if that value is false).

=item PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT

Use the default answer for a prompted questions. C<cpan(1)> sets this
to C<1> unless it already has a value (even if that value is false).

=head1 EXIT VALUES

The script exits with zero if it thinks that everything worked, or a
positive number if it thinks that something failed. Note, however, that
in some cases it has to divine a failure by the output of things it does
not control. For now, the exit codes are vague:

	1	An unknown error

	2	The was an external problem

	4	There was an internal problem with the script

	8	A module failed to install

=head1 TO DO

* one shot configuration values from the command line

=head1 BUGS

* none noted

=head1 SEE ALSO

Most behaviour, including environment variables and configuration,
comes directly from CPAN.pm.

=head1 SOURCE AVAILABILITY

This code is in Github in the CPAN.pm repository:

	https://github.com/andk/cpanpm

The source used to be tracked separately in another GitHub repo,
but the canonical source is now in the above repo.

=head1 CREDITS

Japheth Cleaver added the bits to allow a forced install (-f).

Jim Brandt suggest and provided the initial implementation for the
up-to-date and Changes features.

Adam Kennedy pointed out that exit() causes problems on Windows
where this script ends up with a .bat extension
