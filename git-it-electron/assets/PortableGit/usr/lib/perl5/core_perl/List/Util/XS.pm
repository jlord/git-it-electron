=head1 NAME

List::Util::XS - Indicate if List::Util was compiled with a C compiler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use List::Util::XS 1.20;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<List::Util::XS> can be used as a dependency to ensure List::Util was
installed using a C compiler and that the XS version is installed.

During installation C<$List::Util::XS::VERSION> will be set to
C<undef> if the XS was not compiled.

Starting with release 1.23_03, Scalar-List-Util is B<always> using
the XS implementation, but for backwards compatibility, we still
ship the C<List::Util::XS> module which just loads C<List::Util>.
