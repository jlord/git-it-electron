# GDBM_File.pm -- Perl 5 interface to GNU gdbm library.

=head1 NAME

GDBM_File - Perl5 access to the gdbm library.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GDBM_File ;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<GDBM_File> is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by the GNU gdbm library.  If you intend to use this
module you should really have a copy of the gdbm manualpage at hand.

Most of the libgdbm.a functions are available through the GDBM_File
interface.

=head1 AVAILABILITY

gdbm is available from any GNU archive.  The master site is
C<ftp.gnu.org>, but you are strongly urged to use one of the many
mirrors.  You can obtain a list of mirror sites from
http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html.

=head1 BUGS

The available functions and the gdbm/perl interface need to be documented.

The GDBM error number and error message interface needs to be added.
