=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use URI;

  $uri = URI->new("ldap:$uri_string");
  $dn     = $uri->dn;
  $filter = $uri->filter;
  @attr   = $uri->attributes;
  $scope  = $uri->scope;
  %extn   = $uri->extensions;
  
  $uri = URI->new("ldap:");  # start empty
  $uri->host("ldap.itd.umich.edu");
  $uri->dn("o=University of Michigan,c=US");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<URI::ldap> provides an interface to parse an LDAP URI into its
constituent parts and also to build a URI as described in
RFC 2255.

=head1 METHODS

C<URI::ldap> supports all the generic and server methods defined by
L<URI>, plus the following.

Each of the following methods can be used to set or get the value in
the URI. The values are passed in unescaped form.  None of these
return undefined values, but elements without a default can be empty.
If arguments are given, then a new value is set for the given part
of the URI.

=item $uri->dn( [$new_dn] )

Sets or gets the I<Distinguished Name> part of the URI.  The DN
identifies the base object of the LDAP search.

=item $uri->attributes( [@new_attrs] )

Sets or gets the list of attribute names which are
returned by the search.

=item $uri->scope( [$new_scope] )

Sets or gets the scope to be used by the search. The value can be one of
C<"base">, C<"one"> or C<"sub">. If none is given in the URI then the
return value defaults to C<"base">.

=item $uri->_scope( [$new_scope] )

Same as scope(), but does not default to anything.

=item $uri->filter( [$new_filter] )

Sets or gets the filter to be used by the search. If none is given in
the URI then the return value defaults to C<"(objectClass=*)">.

=item $uri->_filter( [$new_filter] )

Same as filter(), but does not default to anything.

=item $uri->extensions( [$etype => $evalue,...] )

Sets or gets the extensions used for the search. The list passed should
be in the form etype1 => evalue1, etype2 => evalue2,... This is also
the form of list that is returned.
