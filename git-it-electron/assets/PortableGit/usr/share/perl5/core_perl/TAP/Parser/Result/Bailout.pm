  if ( $result->is_bailout ) {
      my $explanation = $result->explanation;
      print "We bailed out because ($explanation)";
  }

If, and only if, a token is a bailout token, you can get an "explanation" via
this method.  The explanation is the text after the mystical "Bail out!" words
which appear in the tap output.
