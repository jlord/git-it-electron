=head1 NAME

open - perl pragma to set default PerlIO layers for input and output

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use open IN  => ":crlf", OUT => ":bytes";
    use open OUT => ':utf8';
    use open IO  => ":encoding(iso-8859-7)";

    use open IO  => ':locale';

    use open ':encoding(utf8)';
    use open ':locale';
    use open ':encoding(iso-8859-7)';

    use open ':std';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Full-fledged support for I/O layers is now implemented provided
Perl is configured to use PerlIO as its IO system (which is now the
default).

The C<open> pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default
"layers" (also known as "disciplines") for all I/O. Any two-argument
open(), readpipe() (aka qx//) and similar operators found within the
lexical scope of this pragma will use the declared defaults.
Even three-argument opens may be affected by this pragma
when they don't specify IO layers in MODE.

With the C<IN> subpragma you can declare the default layers
of input streams, and with the C<OUT> subpragma you can declare
the default layers of output streams.  With the C<IO>  subpragma
you can control both input and output streams simultaneously.

If you have a legacy encoding, you can use the C<:encoding(...)> tag.

If you want to set your encoding layers based on your
locale environment variables, you can use the C<:locale> tag.
For example:

    $ENV{LANG} = 'ru_RU.KOI8-R';
    # the :locale will probe the locale environment variables like LANG
    use open OUT => ':locale';
    open(O, ">koi8");
    print O chr(0x430); # Unicode CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A = KOI8-R 0xc1
    close O;
    open(I, "<koi8");
    printf "%#x\n", ord(<I>), "\n"; # this should print 0xc1
    close I;

These are equivalent

    use open ':encoding(utf8)';
    use open IO => ':encoding(utf8)';

as are these

    use open ':locale';
    use open IO => ':locale';

and these

    use open ':encoding(iso-8859-7)';
    use open IO => ':encoding(iso-8859-7)';

The matching of encoding names is loose: case does not matter, and
many encodings have several aliases.  See L<Encode::Supported> for
details and the list of supported locales.

When open() is given an explicit list of layers (with the three-arg
syntax), they override the list declared using this pragma.  open() can
also be given a single colon (:) for a layer name, to override this pragma
and use the default (C<:raw> on Unix, C<:crlf> on Windows).

The C<:std> subpragma on its own has no effect, but if combined with
the C<:utf8> or C<:encoding> subpragmas, it converts the standard
filehandles (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR) to comply with encoding selected
for input/output handles.  For example, if both input and out are
chosen to be C<:encoding(utf8)>, a C<:std> will mean that STDIN, STDOUT,
and STDERR are also in C<:encoding(utf8)>.  On the other hand, if only
output is chosen to be in C<< :encoding(koi8r) >>, a C<:std> will cause
only the STDOUT and STDERR to be in C<koi8r>.  The C<:locale> subpragma
implicitly turns on C<:std>.

The logic of C<:locale> is described in full in L<encoding>,
but in short it is first trying nl_langinfo(CODESET) and then
guessing from the LC_ALL and LANG locale environment variables.

Directory handles may also support PerlIO layers in the future.

=head1 NONPERLIO FUNCTIONALITY

If Perl is not built to use PerlIO as its IO system then only the two
pseudo-layers C<:bytes> and C<:crlf> are available.

The C<:bytes> layer corresponds to "binary mode" and the C<:crlf>
layer corresponds to "text mode" on platforms that distinguish
between the two modes when opening files (which is many DOS-like
platforms, including Windows).  These two layers are no-ops on
platforms where binmode() is a no-op, but perform their functions
everywhere if PerlIO is enabled.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

There is a class method in C<PerlIO::Layer> C<find> which is
implemented as XS code.  It is called by C<import> to validate the
layers:

   PerlIO::Layer::->find("perlio")

The return value (if defined) is a Perl object, of class
C<PerlIO::Layer> which is created by the C code in F<perlio.c>.  As
yet there is nothing useful you can do with the object at the perl
level.
