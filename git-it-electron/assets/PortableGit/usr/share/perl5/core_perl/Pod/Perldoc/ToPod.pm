=head1 NAME

Pod::Perldoc::ToPod - let Perldoc render Pod as ... Pod!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perldoc -opod Some::Modulename

(That's currently the same as the following:)

  perldoc -u Some::Modulename

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to display Pod source as
itself!  Pretty Zen, huh?

Currently this class works by just filtering out the non-Pod stuff from
a given input file.
