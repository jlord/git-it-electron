=head1 NAME

File::stat - by-name interface to Perl's built-in stat() functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::stat;
 $st = stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
 if ( ($st->mode & 0111) && $st->nlink > 1) ) {
     print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
 } 

 if ( -x $st ) {
     print "$file is executable\n";
 }

 use Fcntl "S_IRUSR";
 if ( $st->cando(S_IRUSR, 1) ) {
     print "My effective uid can read $file\n";
 }

 use File::stat qw(:FIELDS);
 stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
 if ( ($st_mode & 0111) && ($st_nlink > 1) ) {
     print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
 } 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module's default exports override the core stat() 
and lstat() functions, replacing them with versions that return 
"File::stat" objects.  This object has methods that
return the similarly named structure field name from the
stat(2) function; namely,
dev,
ino,
mode,
nlink,
uid,
gid,
rdev,
size,
atime,
mtime,
ctime,
blksize,
and
blocks.  

As of version 1.02 (provided with perl 5.12) the object provides C<"-X">
overloading, so you can call filetest operators (C<-f>, C<-x>, and so
on) on it. It also provides a C<< ->cando >> method, called like

 $st->cando( ACCESS, EFFECTIVE )

where I<ACCESS> is one of C<S_IRUSR>, C<S_IWUSR> or C<S_IXUSR> from the
L<Fcntl|Fcntl> module, and I<EFFECTIVE> indicates whether to use
effective (true) or real (false) ids. The method interprets the C<mode>,
C<uid> and C<gid> fields, and returns whether or not the current process
would be allowed the specified access.

If you don't want to use the objects, you may import the C<< ->cando >>
method into your namespace as a regular function called C<stat_cando>.
This takes an arrayref containing the return values of C<stat> or
C<lstat> as its first argument, and interprets it for you.

You may also import all the structure fields directly into your namespace
as regular variables using the :FIELDS import tag.  (Note that this still
overrides your stat() and lstat() functions.)  Access these fields as
variables named with a preceding C<st_> in front their method names.
Thus, C<$stat_obj-E<gt>dev()> corresponds to $st_dev if you import
the fields.

To access this functionality without the core overrides,
pass the C<use> an empty import list, and then access
function functions with their full qualified names.
On the other hand, the built-ins are still available
via the C<CORE::> pseudo-package.

=head1 BUGS

As of Perl 5.8.0 after using this module you cannot use the implicit
C<$_> or the special filehandle C<_> with stat() or lstat(), trying
to do so leads into strange errors.  The workaround is for C<$_> to
be explicit

    my $stat_obj = stat $_;

and for C<_> to explicitly populate the object using the unexported
and undocumented populate() function with CORE::stat():

    my $stat_obj = File::stat::populate(CORE::stat(_));

=head1 ERRORS

=over 4

=item -%s is not implemented on a File::stat object

The filetest operators C<-t>, C<-T> and C<-B> are not implemented, as
they require more information than just a stat buffer.

=back

=head1 WARNINGS

These can all be disabled with

    no warnings "File::stat";

=over 4

=item File::stat ignores use filetest 'access'

You have tried to use one of the C<-rwxRWX> filetests with C<use
filetest 'access'> in effect. C<File::stat> will ignore the pragma, and
just use the information in the C<mode> member as usual.

=item File::stat ignores VMS ACLs

VMS systems have a permissions structure that cannot be completely
represented in a stat buffer, and unlike on other systems the builtin
filetest operators respect this. The C<File::stat> overloads, however,
do not, since the information required is not available.

=back

=head1 NOTE

While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct
module to build a struct-like class, you shouldn't rely upon this.
