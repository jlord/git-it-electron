=head1 NAME

CPAN::Meta::History - history of CPAN Meta Spec changes

=head1 VERSION

version 2.150001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CPAN Meta Spec has gone through several iterations.  It was
originally written in HTML and later revised into POD (though published
in HTML generated from the POD).  Fields were added, removed or changed,
sometimes by design and sometimes to reflect real-world usage after the
fact.

This document reconstructs the history of the CPAN Meta Spec based on
change logs, repository commit messages and the published HTML files.
In some cases, particularly prior to version 1.2, the exact version
when certain fields were introduced or changed is inconsistent between
sources.  When in doubt, the published HTML files for versions 1.0 to
1.4 as they existed when version 2 was developed are used as the
definitive source.

Starting with version 2, the specification document is part of the
CPAN-Meta distribution and will be published on CPAN as
L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.

Going forward, specification version numbers will be integers and
decimal portions will correspond to a release date for the CPAN::Meta
library.
