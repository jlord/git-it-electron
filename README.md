### A Git-it Desktop App!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The original [Git-it](http://github.com/jlord/git-it) is nearly 1.5 years of age and it's been awesome.

#### Over 2,778 people have completed Git-it!

One of the improvements I've longed to make was to make a better get-git-it-ing experience. Currently users need to install [Git](http://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) before they can start. Installing Git is fine, that's what you're there to learn but installing Node.js, while it isn't hard, is a bit outside the scope for people who are often entirely new to programming, version control and terminal.

Git-it is one of many [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) workshoppers that run lessons inside of terminal to teach a skill, but it isn't actually about learning JavaScript/Node.js itself. _An aside, check out those workshops, Node.js is great and what current Git-it is built with and is still what I'll use to build Git-it with Electron._

### Git-it on Electron

If you don't know, [Electron](http:electron.atom.io), is a tool that lets you build desktop apps (ones you download and click icons on your computer's desktop or dock to run) with only web stuff like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally these applications are written in code native  to different operating systems and thus requires knowing more than just web languages.

Electron takes the web code you've written and packages it up to run on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. This is is awesome.

So I'm going to move Git-it to Electron. You'll still use your terminal to do the Git commands you learn yourself (that's the point!) but Git-it will move from also being in your terminal window to being its own app which display [the guide](http://jlord.github.io/git-it) and verify completed challenges.

### Play Along!

If using web skills to build apps interests you, follow along here!

#### Watch this repo and follow the process of creating a desktop app with Electron!

Extra bonus, you'll see how often I mess up and how sloppy my commit messages are. YOLO.

I will go the extra mile to make good Pull Requests to myself and document the process. Maybe even all the ways I paint my nails while building this. Of course contributions will be welcome, too!
