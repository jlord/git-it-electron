Git-it is a desktop (Mac, Windows and Linux) app that teaches you how to use Git and GitHub on the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

**ðŸš©The app includes translations in these languages: Spanish (ES), Spanish (CO), French, Portugese (BR), Ukrainian, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. ðŸš©**

Previously it ran _in_ terminal (the command line application) with a guide online but now the guide _is_ the app and it runs on your desktop on its own :sparkles: **This will be the only maintained version going forward** :arrow_right:.

## Hello future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters!

This application contains challenges for learning Git and GitHubâ€”by using _real_ Git and GitHub, not emulators. You'll be learning the awesome (and not so scary) command line and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have _real_ repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your [contribution chart](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).

## What to Install

You will need this app, Git-it, git, and a text editor. The first challenge in Git-it helps you get that configured once installed. But if you want to get a head start, go for it! You'll continue to use Git and your text editor throughout your bright social coding future.

As a part of the challenges you'll also create a (free) account on GitHub. If you've already got one, high-five!

### Git

On Windows, download standalone installer from [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
Use default or recommended settings while installing git. You need to the "Git Shell" tas your terminal.

On Mac download and install git following the instructions: [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

On Mac and Linux you can use the app **Terminal**, which is already on your computer.

### Text Editor

Any text editor will do it. Some recommended editors are: [Atom](http://atom.io) which is built on [Electron.js](http://electron.atom.io), just like Git-it, [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io), etc.

### Git-it

You can view the [https://github.com/rambasnet/git-it-electron/releases](https://github.com/rambasnet/git-it-electron/releases) section of this repository to find the download for your operating system. Click to download your version. Once it has downloaded to your default Downloads directory, unzip or extract contents to a folder and run the Git-it executable. The executables for Mac, Windows and Linux:

![executables](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1305617/14696588/2b10abf8-0731-11e6-945e-f3d57114bce9.png)

- **Mac** Right (control) click the Git-it icon, select Open and then Open again. You can drag the icon into your Applications directory if you want, but it's not required. If needed, more [detailed installation instructions](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/issues/121#issue-149747488) can be found in this issue.
- **Windows** Double-click the executable.
- **Linux** Double-click the executable. If the app isn't running, [see this issue](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/issues/182).

## Get Started

Open Git-it and click the button to begin the first challenge. Have your terminal and text editor open, too. Follow along with the instructions in each challenge and use the terminal or editor as instructed.

When you've completed the steps in a challenge click 'Verify'. Depending on the challenge you may need to also select the folder you did your work in for Git-it to verify.

## Tips For Getting Started

### Code snippets

Often times you'll see `$ some command --here`. The dollar sign identifies the line as one a user would enter into the command line, but you don't actually include it when you type it into terminal. In this case, you'd actually just type `some command --here`.

### Variables

Variables are indicated by `< >` e.g., `<VARIABLENAME>` or `<variable_name>`in code snippets. When you actually use the line of code, replace `<VARIABLENAME>`, with your data/value/content. For instance to make a new folder in terminal the format is, `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>`, so if you wanted to make a folder named 'octocat', you'd type: `mkdir octocat`.

### Command line, Terminal and Bash

They all basically mean the same thing: the MS-DOS, Doogie Howser looking screen full of words and numbers. It's awesomely powerful and allows you to control your computer with text commands.

You can do a lot of things from your terminal like delete, rename, copy or create files and folders; run scripts and send things back and forth between servers (like the ones storing things on GitHub.com) and your computer (also a server!).

### Tips for Learning Bash Commands

To lean Linux/Mac Bash commands, this resource [http://linuxcommand.org/index.php](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php) is highly recommended. Note that you can run some basic utility Linux Bash commands even on Windows using git-bash or Powershell. Windows 10 and newer verion allow you to install Ubuntu as an App via WSL; see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for details.
